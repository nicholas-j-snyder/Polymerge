<p>From the Sweltering Furnace plains of Mercury to the frozen ruins of ancient orbital platforms in the distant Ort lit only by the light of a billion distant stars, humanity spread to the far corners of its home system and once were tightly knit together. But that was then, this is now. Much of the of the vast wild arcologies that dominate the Solar System twenty thousand years after the Zenith are inhospitable and unexplored. Ancient ruins lay buried beneath layers of urban jungle and  tangles of processing facilities and pipelines that route vital resources through them.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Those that brave such places often do so carrying only what they can, forming small expeditions into the Depths that rely as much on what’s available as what they can bring in. Characters that players control in POLYMERGE are known as Divers. They venture into the vast expanses of Wild Arcology often risking life and limb to retrieve vital resources or components for the small settlements of Polyhumans that dot the Solar system or at the behest of one of the various factions that has since arose in the absence of The Concordant and other powers of the Zenith. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Down the Well:
Divers will need to prepare before they venture out. If they are starting their first session they are assumed to have everything they need. The party begins with one portable shelter, one powercell per player and ammunition for any weapons that have the AMMO trait.</p>

<p>Going Down: 
Divers will need to be wary of how deep into the various Arcologies they go, all manner of dangers lurk within the depths from crumbling Fusion Furnace that lash out for kilometers around them with vast arcs of energized plasma vortices to Auto-fauna reclimators that skulk in the depths dismantling the unwary to reclaim Wetware for use within their Factory hives. 
	When players first reach an Arcology they must choose their landing sight. A diver is nominated to roll a reaction test(players may also have other means to descend but typically will do so via a drop ship or similar means) and then consult the table below to see the end result. There will be times when the Divers might not need a roll(such as access to an orbital elevator or Quanta tunnel) these will be detailed later.</p>

<p>Reaction roll successes/failures: 
Effect on landing 
3+ Faults
Catastrophic crash: The dive team slams into the surface of the arcology, leaving a wake of debris, wreckage in their path. They begin the session within a Wreckage field Zone and immediately take a hit to their Frame equal to the amount of faults rolled. 
3+ failure
Crash: The Dive team will need to find another way back out of the Arcology. They immediately take D3 Frame Damage and begin their expedition within a Wreckage Field Zone. 
1+ successes 
Landed: The Dive team has landed without incident and proceed as normal.
3+ successes
Planned landing: The Dive team selects an optimal site for their landing, reroll the starting Zone hex. 
2+ Drives
Choice landing: The Dive team has selected the perfect spot. The Pilot may select the starting Zone.</p>

<p>The Travel Phase:
Dive Teams are expected to explore the Arcology wilderness. To help create a flow of events that is not jarring this is called the Exploration phase and operates in some ways similar to combat. Each ‘Round’ of exploration the Dive Team will select which Zone they wish to explore or move into. During the Travel phase a Dive Team may do the following: Move, Explore, Rest and breach. To perform these actions the Dive team must be willing to expend dice.
When the Travel Phase begins each player at the Table(NPCS) included must select either an Application or a Function die and Expend it, reducing their roll with that associated function or application until they are able to reach a place to repair and recover. Not every player must select the same action with the exception of Move and with Breach. As these will result in the team moving in a new Zone.</p>

<p>Move: 
The Dive team moves from one zone to another revealing what it is. They Roll the highest Die that was Expended and Consult the Zone Table.</p>

<p>Explore: 
The Dive Team searches their surroundings. Each diver that opted to Explore this round may roll their expended Die however the Highest result will be the outcome. Should there be any ties add +1 for each tie. Should the team encounter something dangerous only those players that rolled to explore will be considered to be in danger.</p>

<p>Rest:
The team repairs and recovers, seeking shelter. This Costs no dice to perform however if none are expended each player may only use one item and recover one Die that has been expended. If a player Expends a Die each other Diver on the Team(and themselves included) the party then instead may take that many actions/recover that many Dice that have been expended+1.</p>

<p>Breach: 
The Dive Team attempts to move deeper into the Arcology, increasing the depth they are currently at. All players must agree to this. To Attempt a Breach roll the lowest expended die and add any relevant modifiers such as organoids, ties and access nodes that have been collected. If the result is higher than twice the current Depth the players are able to proceed deeper.</p>

<p>Zones:
Zones much like in battle are large areas that a group of Divers will explore to find lost artifacts, ancient corporate vaults or collections of various Inheritors living out their lives within the Arcology wilds. Each Time the Dive team moves they will encounter a new Zone(see moving). Zones can have their own unique locations and events associated with them. 
When a team moves into a new zone the admin will reveal what it is as well as any associated events that are triggered by them entering the area.</p>

<p>Locals:
Natives, be they friendly or hostile, are known as locals. Each planet is host to various distinct tribes and factions that operate within them. How the divers wish to handle them is up to them. Locals can be played immediately or saved for later by either the players or the Admin. The number next to Locals shows how likely that on a given roll they will be encountered as well as the most common type and their disposition.<br>
Hostiles:
The Arcologies are rife with Danger. When characters roll the number(s) in the Hostiles entry during Exploration they have encountered a group of dangerous enemies. Each number will have an associated type of foe next to it such as Auto-fauna, Hostile Dive Teams or Polymer Sickness drones.</p>

<p>Materials:
Ancient relics, caches of Sessile wetware and power supplies. Materials are often what Divers are after the most. Materials can be held in hand or used immediately for their effects. Materials will also have a value listed Chyme, the fluid that backs many currencies and is harvested from Arcologies for building many items. Materials can be sold in friendly settlements or even to ancient auto-vends that lay dormant kilometers down. Materials will typically be found by entering into ruined locations or trading with the locals. Most material is traded back in orbit for Chyme.</p>

<p>Points of interest:
Points of Interest are smaller than entire Zones, ancient Commercial centers, factors and shelters all fall within the category as do more dangerous things such as automated processing houses, reclamator hives and Polymer Sickness Lesions. Points of interest can be played alongside a zone and can serve as landmarks for navigation by being held by players even after they have left the zone. These Points can allow for a rapid ascent back up through a depth should players need to at times. Some Zones will have unique Points of Interest that are tied to that Specific Zone and will be rolled instead on a given outcome. Players may find Points of Interest during Explore actions in the travel phase.</p>

<p>Example Zone: 
Sprawl: 
Locals: 4+(Passive, poly-humans and Autons). 
Hostiles: 1. Autofauna(atta), 6. Hostile Auton or Polyhumans 
Points of Interest:
Res. Suite: 
Found on: 2 
Residential suites are comfortable lodging left over in the memory of the Arcologies from time to time. These luxuriant locations are often excellent sites to take a break at and those that do will automatically recover two expended dice instead of one during a rest action. 
Description: 
Sprawl zones are common near the surface of any arcology. These large meandering housing blocks were meant to emulate the open spaces of an Earth long past. Canals of Effluvia flow between rows of buildings meant to house teeming millions that now lay empty and vacant. Here small Autofauna roam picking away at the softer structures that denser arcology zones lack.</p>

<p>Depth:
Depth determines the overall risk to life and limb that a group of Divers might encounter. Depth starts at a value of zero. A dive team that wishes to go deeper into an Arcology must select their Site. This will be where they venture deeper into the tangle of Wiring, machinery and structures that have grown rampant over the preceding millenia.</p>
