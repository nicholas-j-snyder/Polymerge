Scraps of wetware to ensure their organoids are healthy, refurbished weapons that have become fused to structural moorings after millenia of corrosion or even armor hammered into shape from the husks of dead Auto-fauna. These pieces of equipment can make the difference between a Diver being forever trapped in a broken body, lost in the Depths of an arcology wilderness and returning triumphant bearing artifacts and secrets of another age. This section will cover the various weapons, armor, tools, programs and organoids that a character may make use of as they plumb the depths of the Arcologies that now dominate the Solar System.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creating a Character</title><link href="https://nicholas-j-snyder.github.io/Polymerge/markdown/2021/12/12/Character-Creation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creating a Character" /><published>2021-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nicholas-j-snyder.github.io/Polymerge/markdown/2021/12/12/Character%20Creation</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Creating a Character:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Exploring the Solar System</title><link href="https://nicholas-j-snyder.github.io/Polymerge/markdown/2021/12/12/Exploring-the-Solar-System.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring the Solar System" /><published>2021-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nicholas-j-snyder.github.io/Polymerge/markdown/2021/12/12/Exploring%20the%20Solar%20System</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Exploring the Solar System:</summary></entry></feed>
