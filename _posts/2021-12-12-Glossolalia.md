## What this is:

*POLYMERGE* is a TTRPG/world inspired by the works of the likes of Tsumoto Nihei, Giger and countless others. This is a dark far future sci-fantasy world that takes place within our Solar System after it has been radically altered by mankind for thousands of years and then left to stagnate into a new dark age that has lasted for twenty-thousand years. In it players will adventure through Arcology Wilds, vast living cityscapes that grow and change of their own accord that have become inhabited by Auto-Fauna  

# Glossolalia: 

**Admin:** The Game master, they adjudicate the various challenges that players will encounter as they explore the Solar System. 

**Diver:** The player Character’s avatar in the Game World. Divers explore dangerous parts of the Solar System in hopes of finding ancient artifacts and riches. 

**Auto-fauna:** The various non-sentient, animal-like machine organisms that inhabit the Solar system. Auto-fauna arose from the vehicles, devices and factories that Humanity had constructed during the Zenith, a previous golden age. 

**Polymer:** A form of stable meta-material that was used to engineer the technology of the Zenith. In its raw state it has a pearlescent shine. 

**Polyrobe:** a form of machine-organism that is microscopic in scale and was used for a wide array of purposes ranging from engineering to medicine. An uncontrolled strain of Polyrobe is responsible for the outbreak of Polymer Sickness. 

**Polymer Sickness:** A disease that originated from a variety of polyrobe meant to terraform planets. It devastated the Solar System and ended the Zenith, a golden age. Polymer sickness is capable of rapidly and grotesquely mutating the hosts into drone bodies used to carry out the corrupted core programming of aggressive terraforming and Network setup. 

**Inheritors:** The Various Species that arose after the Zenith which are descended from Humans or their creations. 

**Organoids:** Various techno-organic implantable organs that are used for a wide array of purposes ranging from armor and weaponry to more utilitarian uses such as gaining access to secure sites or the Wires. 

**The Wires:** Various now unstable networks that made up the information and economic systems of the Zenith era. Used by all manner of entities to ‘jaunt’ and gain access to information and data that might otherwise be lost. 

**Wetware:** The semi-organic tissues that comprise much of the Post-zenith technology and life forms. Wetware is integrated through Polymer and can be consumed both for nutrition and to enhance organoids. 

**The Zenith:** The era in which Humanity was able to engineer much of the technology that now runs rampant. The Zenith saw large-scale use of the resources of the Solar System and the start towards such things as Interstellar Travel and manipulation of fundamental forces such as gravity. The setting of Polymerge is set over twenty-thousand years after the end of the Zenith after Polymer-Sickness destroyed that society and its infrastructure.
