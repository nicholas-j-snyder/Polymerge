            "content": "The Wires: . Those that traverse the various fragmented networks of the Solar System are known by a hundred names, cutters, splicers, runners, the lost… But all share the common trait of knowing the means to Jaunt, or move through the Wires even if they do at great risk to their mental state and even sense of self but, the rewards for those that can survive and access sections of long forgotten data stores and overrides however is immense. In this section we will talk about the Wires, how a character Jaunts into them and the types of programs and risks they might encounter while in it. . Jaunts: We use the term Jaunt to describe when a character is accessing the complex network that is the Wires. To do so outside of combat a character can simply select the program they wish to use so long as they have the required amount of Process rating. If they do not they must use items, organoids or their Ghost rating to boost the rating but then must test. In Combat a character must spend their full Turn to activate a Jaunt. If they do so they may take no further action physically for the rest of the round. At the start of their next turn they may begin to perform actions in the Wires. Once they have started acting within the Wires they must be aware of the length of time that they are within the network. A character may spend a number of Rounds within the Wires without penalty equal to their Ghost-the current Depth. Once they have exceeded this number of rounds they will then lose one die for each additional round they are on a jaunt. A character can always exit and retry a jaunt but must spend their actions and lose the benefits of any ongoing programs if they do. . Actions in the Wires: Characters at the start of each round must Test their Process function instead of Reaction. This determines not only the turn on which they move but also many actions they can take during their turn. A character in the Wires adds the total amount of Success and Drives they rolled together, subtracting any Faults. For each success they gain one ‘process point’ for each Drive they gain two and for each fault rolled they lose one point. Process points are used to take actions in the Wires in a manner similar to how characters move within the physical world. They may use them in the following manner: . Execute(1+process point): Execute is the simplest action a character can take on a Jaunt. They expend a certain number of process points to activate a program that they have in their inventory and then apply its effects to the target. . Cache(1+ process point): The character stores an amount of Process Points equal to their Threading rating. These points can be carried over into the next round. However a character loses one die from their Process Test at the start of the next round for every 2 points saved this way. . Crypt(2+process point): A character may use this before an execute action. If they do so, any tests that the program requires will need one additional success for every two points used to crypt. A character can spend a number of process points this way equal to their Encryption rating. Additionally this may be used as a reaction to a hostile program by reducing the Test required by it by one for every two points. . Partition(1+process points): The character creates a segmented space within the Wires. This can help stave off infectious mal-memetics and ego-virii. A character that uses Partition increases the cost of any program used for the Round by the amount of Process Points they expended. They may do this up to their Encryption rating. If the Character that creates the Partition uses an Execute action however this effect immediately ends. . Variance( Process equal to current Round): A character may try to shift their location in relation to the world around them, accessing sections of the Wire that might otherwise be hard to reach or even prepare to translate into a new body on the fly. A character that uses Variance must spend a number of points equal to their current Depth. If they do so at the start of the next round they may treat their Jaunt as being at one Depth higher or lower effectively increasing or decreasing their current duration. . Programs: Programs are the primary means by which a character interacts with the Wires. These are stored within the minds of a character and can be called upon to perform various actions such as attacking a hostile entity or defending against security elements. Some Programs also allow characters in the Wires to interact with the physical world via changing the surrounding Arcology or summoning Auto-fauna. Characters can have as many programs as their Process and Threading ratings combined. Unlike Organoids characters cannot have more Programs than they do rating. All programs require a certain amount of Process Points to use, some however might require additional costs such as a minimum rating in Ghost or a certain depth or zone. Characters using such programs must be aware of these costs. . Duration, Depth and Security elements: Characters that Jaunt need to be aware of how long they are in the Wires not only due to the increased strain that results from wandering within the fragmented networks and servers of the post-Zenith solar system but also due to the risk of drawing the attention of long dormant security measures. When a character rolls more Faults than the current Depth they have stumbled across a hostile entity of the Wires. These are not like Auto-fauna or even Wire Walkers and Deserters but are much more primitive and dangerous programs designed to seek out and destroy trespassers. Security elements attack anything at the Current Depth that is on a Jaunt(a character may use Variance for example to avoid them). Security elements are considered to have a number of Process points each round equal to the current Depth. They do not need to roll at the start of a round and will always have that many to use. Security elements can only use the Execute action if a security element spends all their Process Points in a single round they are considered to have deactivated. Should they be targeted by damaging programs a character reduces their available process points, if this reaches zero they have shut down the security element. Security Elements have two programs available to them: . Fragment: Cost: 1+ Effect: This program deals Noise Damage equal to the amount of process points spent on this action. . Alert; Cost: 1+number of active security elements at current depth. Effect; When this program is used at the start of the next round one additional Security element with a number of Process Points equal to the current Depth -1 enters the Wires. .",

            "title": "Gearing Up",
            "content": "Gearing Up: . Characters in Polymerge often will need to find what they can to survive. Scraps of wetware to ensure their organoids are healthy, refurbished weapons that have become fused to structural moorings after millenia of corrosion or even armor hammered into shape from the husks of dead Auto-fauna. These pieces of equipment can make the difference between a Diver being forever trapped in a broken body, lost in the Depths of an arcology wilderness and returning triumphant bearing artifacts and secrets of another age. This section will cover the various weapons, armor, tools, programs and organoids that a character may make use of as they plumb the depths of the Arcologies that now dominate the Solar System. . The Armory: Mankind and its descendants have long mastered the art of killing. During the Zenith murder was high art for those that controlled their own lives and a means to entertain the enthralled masses. Weaponry of all manner was available to those with the means to afford such deadly treasures. But that was then, this is now. Since the Fall, the descendants of Humanity have cobbled together scraps from that bygone era. These are pale imitations to the devastating tools of war that their ancestors and creators employed but deadly no less. . Damage Rating: The type of damage matters but there is also the matter of how much. Characters in polymerge have a variety of options to choose from in this regard. The exact shape of the weapon matters little and is left up to the players/admin. Rather we focus on the amount of Damage that a weapon does. This determines the cost of the weapon in question when combined with the Damage type and any other special qualities the weapon might have. We determine the base cost of a weapon by multiplying the amount of damage it deals(1-10) by 100. This sets our basic cost. Characters starting play however are limited to weaponry that deals between 1-4 damage. . Damage Types: In Polymerge weaponry has a Damage rating and a Damage type. These two factors determine how much damage a weapon does and to what Function or Root it targets. The following forms of Damage and what they target are below, additionally each category has a cost multiplier associated with it for pricing a weapon in category: . Kinetic: Target: Structure Cost Multiplier: 1x Kinetic damage is one of the oldest means of dispatching a foe. Characterized by sheer brute force it can wreak havoc on the integrity of an entity’s body and destroy critical structures within them. Kinetic weapons are typically simple in nature such as caseless rifles, simple melee weapons and even limbs being swung hard enough to shatter bone. . Remote: Target: Reaction Cost Multiplier: 1.5x Remote weaponry is designed to control the movements of their target, hemming in their actions by guessing where they will be and preventing counter moves. Such weapons are relatively common and serve as a means to fight against nimble enemies such as certain strains of proxy and auto-fauna. Common examples of remote weapons include homing cluster missiles, Splines and smart guns. . Energy: Target: Power Cost Multiplier: 2x Directed energy weapons can be deadly in the right hands. They can burn out delicate neural circuits and cause faults in cardiac regulators triggering cascading failure through key systems and even organoid damage. Energy weapons are rarer than they were during the Zenith, the delicate lenses, catalysts and tissues needed for them are harder to come by than they once were. Common Energy weapons include Microwave emitters and Electromagnetic blasting pikes. . Reactive: Target: Frame Cost: 4x Reactive weaponry is designed to break down the very chemical bonds of a structure. It dismembers and destroys with impunity and can be devastating to those that are not properly armored for such a weapon. Common Reactive weapons include Synergy blades and Hellburner rifles. . Noise: Target: Process Cost: 1x Weapons that deal noise damage are meant to drown out the ability of an entity to think clearly. They override the senses with clutter and throw the mind into disarray. Noise is often the simplest method of attack for entities residing in the wires. Examples of Noise weaponry include Programs such as Choir and Cacophony. . Memetic: Target: Personality Cost: 1.5x Weapons that deal memtic damage overwrite and implant intrusive ideas into the mental framework of the target. These are often used not to kill but render a target unable to call for help or sabotage them in some subtle means. Examples of weapons that deal memetic damage include programs such as Ticker, and Fugue. . Phage: Target: Polymer Cost: 2x Polyrobes were long ago weaponized. Weapons that deal phage damage use aggressive, often short lived strains to override and disable their targets ability to use organoids and take in Polymer. Phage weapons including Heme spikes and PS cultures. Obliteration: Target: Ghost Cost: 4x Weapons that deal Obliteration damage are designed not to simply kill but erase. These are devastating as they can remove and delete otherwise well protected core personality engrams and memories rendering a target little more than an empty husk. Examples of obliteration weapons include Programs such as Mercy and Reset. . Gravitic: Target: All Cost: 10x Gravitic weapons were some of the most devastating creations of the Zenith era. These often humble looking weapons were able to manipulate gravity fields to rapidly increase localized gravity in some manner. The most common example of these were Neutron Rifles that could launch a piece of condensed matter at near relativistic speed. The effects were such that Cleanser teams of Wardens would often fire a single round during sterilization, and remove entire lesions in the process. Gravitic weapons deal their damage rating to all Roots and Functions at Once. They can still be cascaded however. . Qualities: Weapons in Polymerge along with a Damage Rating, and a Damage Type also often have qualities. These impart special effects onto the weapons and change how they function. All weapons have at least one of the Following Qualities: Melee or Ranged, Wired. For each additional quality a character must factor in the cost of the quality. . Melee: Cost: 0 Melee weapons use the Strike Function to make attacks. . Ranged: Cost: 0 Ranged weapons use the Targeting function to make attacks . Wired: Cost: 0 Wired Weapons use the Process Function and are treated as Programs. They require 1 process point for each point of damage they deal to be used. . Other Qualities: Barrage: Cost: 100/rank This weapon can hit several targets at once, when a character makes a successful attack with a weapon with the Barrage quality, for each Drive rolled they may distribute one point of damage to another target within the same Zone. . Quick Attack: Cost: 200/rank(max three) This weapon is designed for rapid successive attacks. A character that rolls 4 drives(-1 per rank) may make an immediate attack at -1damage after the first, they must still roll. Should a character roll enough Drives to activate Quick attack again they may do so again with the same penalties to damage. . Hybrid: Cost: X Hybrid weaponry can deal damage with a second Damage type. When this weapon is built add in the cost of the Hybrid Weapons Damage Rating and Type to the Base weapon. The Hybrid function cannot be used in the same action as the normal attack however and a character must declare if they are using the Hybrid quality before they use the weapon. . Distance: Cost: 50/rank This weapon can hit targets in other zones. All weapons start with a base Distance of 0 meaning they can only hit characters in the same zone. For each rank bought(up to the Damage Rating of the weapon) this weapon can hit a target that many Zones away. . Ammo: Cost: 25/rank Weapons with the Ammo quality have a limited amount of ammo, while many weapons of the Zenith either generate their own ammunition or use such esoteric methods such as Directed light and electromagnetic radiation to attack. Some weapons still have a limited amount of ammunition. A character wielding a weapon with the Ammo quality may expend a point of the Ammo rank to add +1d6 to their next attack roll with this weapon. They may do this as many times as their reaction function. However, a weapon that has reduced their Ammo rating to Zero can no longer be used without being reloaded using a magazine. . Destructive: Cost: 500/rank This weapon is immensely powerful and can turn whole swathes of arcology into little more than Rubble. For Each rank of Destructive a character can spend a Drive. If they spend enough Drives on their attack roll to exceed the current depth the Zone they are in as well as any Zones within range of the attack are reduced to Rubble. In addition the attack hits all targets within the same Zone that is destroyed. . Pierce: Cost: 100/rank This weapon is able to negate a certain amount of protection offered by armor. For each rank of Pierce this weapon ignores one point of Armor. . Linger: Cost: 50/rank This weapon’s effects can carry over into the rounds after its initial hit. When a character makes a successful attack with a weapon that Linger. Each Round after it does one point less of damage to the same Function or route until it no longer deals damage. These effects cannot stack. . Charge; Cost/Refund: 25xDamage Rating This weapon needs to generate a certain amount of power before it can deal it’s full damage. Charge weapons require a number of actions equal to the Damage rating of the weapon before an attack can be made at its full rating. A character can always opt to use it as a partial charge but this reduces the Damage dealt by the number of actions spent charging to a minimum of one. . Unstable: Cost/Refund: 50xDamage Rating This weapon is not safe to handle with unskilled hands. A character that rolls any faults when making an attack with this weapon suffers an immediate hit with the weapon equal to the amount of Faults rolled(up to the Damage Rating). This will happen even if the attack was successful. . Recoil: Cost/refund: 25x rank(max damage rating) This weapon has substantial force behind its shots or swings and its users must be capable of handling the blowback of force. When a character makes an attack roll and produces a number of faults greater than the Recoil rating faults they must immediately make a Force or Structure test that requires a number of successes equal to the damage rating of the weapon. If they do fail they cannot attack with this weapon the next turn and lose as many actions as the Recoil Rating. . Armor: While there are certainly many ways for a character to take damage there are near as many to protect themselves. Armor covers a character and helps mitigate damage. Armor can be used in two ways, the first is passively this automatically reduces incoming damage from attacks by the rating of the armor. The second is Actively, a character may reduce the rating of the armor they are wearing by one. If they do so, they negate all incoming damage from the attack but now have one less point of armor protecting them going forward. . Light, medium, Heavy: Armor is divided into Light, medium and heavy grades. Each type has its own multiplier for cost alongside the given rating. Light armor has a base multiplier of fifty, Medium armor has a base multiplier of one hundred and heavy a base multiplier of 150. Below is a chart showing the range for armor to be considered each class: . Class/multiplier Rating light/x50 1 light /x50 2 medium/x100 3 medium/x100 4 Heavy/x150 5 Heavy/x150 6 . Armor Types: Armor comes in three Broad Types that cover a given group of roots and Functions. They are explained below. . Composite: Composite protects Frame and all of its Functions. This type of armor is typically made of hardened plates of Auto-fauna hulls or produced from processed Chyme residue. Composite armor is common throughout the Solar System. . Cryptic: Cryptic armor is typically integrated into the body in some manner such as through neural packets or via specialized organoids. Cryptic Armor protects the Ghost Root and its Functions. . Cyte: Cyte Armors are rare and are exemplified by the likes of Vacusytes and Karasytes. These are integrated organoids typically that enclose their host wearer and provide coverage against not only Physical attack by assaults via the Wires through the use of their own cryptic neural patterns acting to protect a character wearing one from all manner of harm. Cyte Armor also is automatically double the cost of what the armor normally would be. . Qualities: Like weapons, armor can have additional qualities that set it apart. Below we list some common qualities and their cost increases. Armor can only have one positive and one negative quality. . Reinforced: Cost: 100/rank This armor is designed to withstand a specific type of damage. When its built a character may select the Damage Type and Rank of the Reinforcement. When hit by attacks that deal that type of damage it adds that amount of rating to its defense. . Bulky: Refund: 100 This armor is not well suited to rapid movement. A character wearing armor with the Bulky quality takes a -1D to reaction tests. . Ablative: Cost: 200 Ablative armor is designed to withstand additional punishment, shedding less armor when it absorbs a particular massive hit. When a character uses their armor actively, roll a D6 if the die result is less than the rating of the armor it does not lose a point of rating. However if the result is over it loses two points instead as the layers are burned/shattered far faster than it was designed for. . Stealth: Cost: 200 This armor is designed to blend in with the Surrounding Arcology or network systems. When a Character is using Armor with the Stealth Quality they may reroll a Reaction die once per test if the armor is Composite or Extend the Length of a Jaunt by one round if the Armor is Cryptic. . Specialized: Cost: 100/rank When this armor is made select a specific damage type. When a character is hit with this type of damage they add the Rating of this quality to the armor. . Extremely Bulky: Refund: 200 This armor is heavy enough to slow down most wearers. A character takes a penalty to their reaction Tests Equal to the difference between the Armor rating and the Characters Structure Function. Kinetic attacks against the character deal -1 damage. Characters wearing Extremely Bulky armor always take a minimum of -1d to their Reaction rolls regardless of if there would be no penalty. . Organoids: Organoids fill a wide array of roles in the setting of POLYMERGE. Characters will need to be conscious not only of how many organoids they have but of how much power they require. Organoids are in essence grafted into the tissues of the host body and can be removed with some effort and a skilled technician’s hand. Each Organoid has an amount of Mass it requires within the body as well as an amount of Charge to be active. Characters can only have as many Organoids as their mass however they may have more than their Charge rating. Additionally Organoids can be ‘cultivated’ by a character through the ingestion of Wetware. When a character ingests enough Wetware equal to the Cultivation rating of the Organoid they may ‘cultivate’ this can offer increased bonuses, new ways to use the organoid or even the ability to generate an extra copy. When a Character takes damage we reduce the Mass rating of Organoids should the Mass rating be reduced to zero the organoid is considered destroyed. Additionally a damage Organoid cannot be cultivated and any wetware ingested instead repairs the organoid by 1 point for each wetware consumed. Below we will list a few common Organoids and how they operate. . Neural Interfacer: Mass: 2 Charge: 0 Cultivation: 4 This organoid is one of the most common, grafting itself into the cerebrum and allowing a character to interact with various craft. Neural Interfacers are usually specially designed for a specific type of vessel such as atmospheric or vacuum capable ships. Cultivation effect: This organoid can be copied generating a new organoid that can then be harvested from the host body or, it can broaden its format code allowing it to interface with another type of vessel. Special: the organoid requires at least one unit of wetware from the new type of vessel it is interfacing with. . Neural Buffer: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation: 3 This organoid was likely an offshoot of interfacers. Its structure is similar to that ancient form. These however are designed with the Wires in mind and grant the Character Cryptic Armor of a rating of 1. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can be cultivated to better encrypt the engrams of a character and can be cultivated to increase its Cryptic rating by 1. It also can be cultivated to better enable Jaunts and gain the Stealth Quality instead. . Jaunt Organoid,basic: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation: 2 This is one of the oldest forms of organoid. Developed first during the Zenith and produced en masse ever sense. This allows a character access to the Wires and the use of Programs. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can be cultivated to better access the Wires, extending the Duration of a jaunt by one additional round per cultivation or it can be nourished to better process data streams, upgrading one die of a Process Function test. . Spline: Mass: 2 Charge: 2 Cultivation Cost: 4 This Organoid is designed for combat, Anchoring itself into the body via the rib cage and controlled via the Spinal cord. Splines are considered Composite Armor with a Rating of 1. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can replicate creating multiple splines to defend the Host, for each cultivation performed increase the rating by 1. Additionally it can be cultivated into a deadly weapon, if cultivated in this manner the Spline is treated as a melee weapon that deals Kinetic damage equal to its rating. If this is done however it cannot be used to defend in the same round that it attacks. . Identifiers: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation Cost: N/A Identifiers are special organoids that are used by various factions as a means to ensure security of their facilities. Identifiers are able to access their home domains. . Catalyzers: Mass: 3 Charge: 2 Cultivation Cost: 6 Catalyzers are special organoids designed to allow beings to process various substances that otherwise might be toxic. A character that has a catalyzer is able to consume a substance and in turn generate wetware that is incorporated into their bodies. The Rate of Catalyzing is the same as the Cultivation cost(6:1). This wetware can be used by other Organoids for Cultivation inside the characters body or harvested with a Reaction test of 2. Cultivation effect: By cultivation a character can adapt the organoid into metabolizing other substances of their choosing(such as Chyme or Composite) or reduce the Ratio needed for wetware by one. This latter ability can be cultivated up to three times. .",

            "title": "Exploring the Solar System",
            "content": "Exploring the Solar System: . From the Sweltering Furnace plains of Mercury to the frozen ruins of ancient orbital platforms in the distant Ort lit only by the light of a billion distant stars, humanity spread to the far corners of its home system and once were tightly knit together. But that was then, this is now. Much of the of the vast wild arcologies that dominate the Solar System twenty thousand years after the Zenith are inhospitable and unexplored. Ancient ruins lay buried beneath layers of urban jungle and tangles of processing facilities and pipelines that route vital resources through them. . Those that brave such places often do so carrying only what they can, forming small expeditions into the Depths that rely as much on what’s available as what they can bring in. Characters that players control in POLYMERGE are known as Divers. They venture into the vast expanses of Wild Arcology often risking life and limb to retrieve vital resources or components for the small settlements of Polyhumans that dot the Solar system or at the behest of one of the various factions that has since arose in the absence of The Concordant and other powers of the Zenith. . Down the Well: Divers will need to prepare before they venture out. If they are starting their first session they are assumed to have everything they need. The party begins with one portable shelter, one powercell per player and ammunition for any weapons that have the AMMO trait. . Going Down: Divers will need to be wary of how deep into the various Arcologies they go, all manner of dangers lurk within the depths from crumbling Fusion Furnace that lash out for kilometers around them with vast arcs of energized plasma vortices to Auto-fauna reclimators that skulk in the depths dismantling the unwary to reclaim Wetware for use within their Factory hives. When players first reach an Arcology they must choose their landing sight. A diver is nominated to roll a reaction test(players may also have other means to descend but typically will do so via a drop ship or similar means) and then consult the table below to see the end result. There will be times when the Divers might not need a roll(such as access to an orbital elevator or Quanta tunnel) these will be detailed later. . Reaction roll successes/failures: Effect on landing 3+ Faults Catastrophic crash: The dive team slams into the surface of the arcology, leaving a wake of debris, wreckage in their path. They begin the session within a Wreckage field Zone and immediately take a hit to their Frame equal to the amount of faults rolled. 3+ failure Crash: The Dive team will need to find another way back out of the Arcology. They immediately take D3 Frame Damage and begin their expedition within a Wreckage Field Zone. 1+ successes Landed: The Dive team has landed without incident and proceed as normal. 3+ successes Planned landing: The Dive team selects an optimal site for their landing, reroll the starting Zone hex. 2+ Drives Choice landing: The Dive team has selected the perfect spot. The Pilot may select the starting Zone. . The Travel Phase: Dive Teams are expected to explore the Arcology wilderness. To help create a flow of events that is not jarring this is called the Exploration phase and operates in some ways similar to combat. Each ‘Round’ of exploration the Dive Team will select which Zone they wish to explore or move into. During the Travel phase a Dive Team may do the following: Move, Explore, Rest and breach. To perform these actions the Dive team must be willing to expend dice. When the Travel Phase begins each player at the Table(NPCS) included must select either an Application or a Function die and Expend it, reducing their roll with that associated function or application until they are able to reach a place to repair and recover. Not every player must select the same action with the exception of Move and with Breach. As these will result in the team moving in a new Zone. . Move: The Dive team moves from one zone to another revealing what it is. They Roll the highest Die that was Expended and Consult the Zone Table. . Explore: The Dive Team searches their surroundings. Each diver that opted to Explore this round may roll their expended Die however the Highest result will be the outcome. Should there be any ties add +1 for each tie. Should the team encounter something dangerous only those players that rolled to explore will be considered to be in danger. . Rest: The team repairs and recovers, seeking shelter. This Costs no dice to perform however if none are expended each player may only use one item and recover one Die that has been expended. If a player Expends a Die each other Diver on the Team(and themselves included) the party then instead may take that many actions/recover that many Dice that have been expended+1. . Breach: The Dive Team attempts to move deeper into the Arcology, increasing the depth they are currently at. All players must agree to this. To Attempt a Breach roll the lowest expended die and add any relevant modifiers such as organoids, ties and access nodes that have been collected. If the result is higher than twice the current Depth the players are able to proceed deeper. . Zones: Zones much like in battle are large areas that a group of Divers will explore to find lost artifacts, ancient corporate vaults or collections of various Inheritors living out their lives within the Arcology wilds. Each Time the Dive team moves they will encounter a new Zone(see moving). Zones can have their own unique locations and events associated with them. When a team moves into a new zone the admin will reveal what it is as well as any associated events that are triggered by them entering the area. . Locals: Natives, be they friendly or hostile, are known as locals. Each planet is host to various distinct tribes and factions that operate within them. How the divers wish to handle them is up to them. Locals can be played immediately or saved for later by either the players or the Admin. The number next to Locals shows how likely that on a given roll they will be encountered as well as the most common type and their disposition. Hostiles: The Arcologies are rife with Danger. When characters roll the number(s) in the Hostiles entry during Exploration they have encountered a group of dangerous enemies. Each number will have an associated type of foe next to it such as Auto-fauna, Hostile Dive Teams or Polymer Sickness drones. . Materials: Ancient relics, caches of Sessile wetware and power supplies. Materials are often what Divers are after the most. Materials can be held in hand or used immediately for their effects. Materials will also have a value listed Chyme, the fluid that backs many currencies and is harvested from Arcologies for building many items. Materials can be sold in friendly settlements or even to ancient auto-vends that lay dormant kilometers down. Materials will typically be found by entering into ruined locations or trading with the locals. Most material is traded back in orbit for Chyme. . Points of interest: Points of Interest are smaller than entire Zones, ancient Commercial centers, factors and shelters all fall within the category as do more dangerous things such as automated processing houses, reclamator hives and Polymer Sickness Lesions. Points of interest can be played alongside a zone and can serve as landmarks for navigation by being held by players even after they have left the zone. These Points can allow for a rapid ascent back up through a depth should players need to at times. Some Zones will have unique Points of Interest that are tied to that Specific Zone and will be rolled instead on a given outcome. Players may find Points of Interest during Explore actions in the travel phase. . Example Zone: Sprawl: Locals: 4+(Passive, poly-humans and Autons). Hostiles: 1. Autofauna(atta), 6. Hostile Auton or Polyhumans Points of Interest: Res. Suite: Found on: 2 Residential suites are comfortable lodging left over in the memory of the Arcologies from time to time. These luxuriant locations are often excellent sites to take a break at and those that do will automatically recover two expended dice instead of one during a rest action. Description: Sprawl zones are common near the surface of any arcology. These large meandering housing blocks were meant to emulate the open spaces of an Earth long past. Canals of Effluvia flow between rows of buildings meant to house teeming millions that now lay empty and vacant. Here small Autofauna roam picking away at the softer structures that denser arcology zones lack. . Depth: Depth determines the overall risk to life and limb that a group of Divers might encounter. Depth starts at a value of zero. A dive team that wishes to go deeper into an Arcology must select their Site. This will be where they venture deeper into the tangle of Wiring, machinery and structures that have grown rampant over the preceding millenia. .",

            "content": "COMBAT . The Era of the Post-Zenith is one abundant in danger. Auto-fauna roam the Arcologies alongside hostile groups of mercenaries, Cast off proxies and ancient Defense networks. As such many that explore the Arcologies are ready to fight for their lives. Combat in POLYMERGE is meant to be tense, fast paced and tactical to a degree. Characters that get into combat in POLYMERGE must plan carefully, selecting the appropriate weaponry, organoids and Hemes to survive. . The Round: We divide combat in POLYMERGE into various Rounds of combat. These are discrete but abstracted units of time in which characters may take actions such as Shooting, diving for cover or Jaunting. Each Round is further divided into Turns in which characters may act out their choice of action and determine the degree to which they were able to accomplish it. . The Turn: While we treat combat as a simultaneous event in which all parties are moving at once. We as players divide the round into turns. Each member of the Combat(Divers, Autofauna, NPCs etc.) will get to declare their chosen moves on their turn. A character will typically have 2 Actions to use during their turn. Characters with the Efficiency application gain one additional action per TWO ranks with the application. Additionally a Character may EXPEND a point of their Charge Rating to gain an additional action, this can be done a number of times equal to their Routing Application or once if they have no rating in it. . Actions: Characters in POLYMERGE can take a variety of actions in combat ranging from firing their weapon, charging a foe or diving from cover. Below we will go over the most common types of Actions that a character may perform while in a fight: . Attack(variable cost): The attack action is one of the most basic moves a character can take in combat. An attack requires a different amount of actions to use depending upon the weapon used by a character. An attack can be a standard test or a Vs. test. . Defend(1 action): Oftentimes a character will not simply take a hit. Characters can defend themselves By using Reaction, or Structure. Defend is a unique action because it can be used during another character’s turn. Doing so allows a character to turn an attack action into a versus test against their roll. If the defending character succeeds they negate the incoming damage completely. If the attacker beats the defender, they suffer the net success in damage. . Use(1 action): Characters may use items, or environmental effects to their advantage in combat. The Use action can be used only during a character’s turn though its effects might persist for longer. . Activate(1 action): A character may spend an action to activate an Organoid they are currently installed with. They must spend one action for each Organoid they wish to use as well as have the required amount of Charge to power it. . Jaunt(Special): A character may attempt to access the Wires during combat to execute a program. To do so they must spend at least once action to access the area network(see Jaunting for more). A character that has Jaunted cannot take further actions until they log out and cannot react to actions around them. They are treated as defenseless and immobile. . Aim/ready(1+ actions): Characters may sometimes need to take aim to make sure a shot lands or prepare a weapon for firing. When a character takes aim they convert one die into one automatic Success. They may do this once, or up to the number of times they have the Targeting application. Characters that are readying a weapon must expend a number of actions equal to the Weapons Charge/Recoil rating. . Charge(1+action): A character that charges is moving to close the gap between them and their target. This is typically done with melee weapons though some ranged weapons can be used while charging. A character that charges may move a number of zones equal to the actions they spend to do so and may if they reach a valid target immediately attack it. . Move(1+ action): A character may move from one Zone to another during combat. If they wish to move more than one zone at a time they must use more actions during their turn to do so. It should be noted some Zones might cost more actions to move through(such as wreckage). If a character moves from such a zone to one without a penalty(Wreckage to sprawl for example) they still must use the higher rate of actions for the initial move. . Attacking at range and in melee: Characters making an attack must consider where they are in relation to their target. When a character makes a ranged attack they must note how many zones away they are from their target, ranged weapons will have a Range(1-5 typically) this represents how many zones away a character can make an attack from. This does not mean they cannot try from further but suffer a -1D penalty for each zone they are further away from the target. Melee attacks must take place in the same zone as the target. Should they not be within the same zone the attack automatically will fail. . Armor: Protection comes in many forms in the world of POLYMERGE. Armor can be something as humble as the carapace of Auto-fauna hammered into a simple breastplate to something as Esoteric as a neutron shield that redirects incoming light or even a jamming signal meant to block out attacks from the Wires. Armor is divided into three broad classes: light(1-2), medium(3-4) and heavy(5-6). And has a corresponding Code much like weapons(refer to the table in Taking damage for further information on codes). This represents the area that is protected first by the armor such as Structure or Reaction while the number represent . Taking Damage: Eventually a character will have their luck run out. A stray shot will land, a shard of shrapnel will find its mark or a Polycyte will burrow into flesh. When a character takes damage they are losing their ability to function. Characters in POLYMERGE do not have Hit points rather they suffer damage to their various functions and applications. Weapons in POLYMERGE have an abbreviation: . Frame/FRA Ghost/GHO Structure/STR Process/PRO Reaction/REACT Personality/PER Power/POW Polymer/POLY . The corresponding Root or function is what will be affected by the attack first. A character may opt to either absorb the full damage at the targeted location OR they may Cascade the attack(Note a character wearing armor meant to protect the targeted area or a higher layer such as a Root can absorb the attack first with the armor reducing its rating by the amount of damage), distributing damage throughout their systems. A character that opts to Cascade must still take at least one point of damage to the targeted Function or Root. They may then distribute any further damage into lower layers(Applications, Derived Attributes, or certain pieces of gear or certain Organoids). At each layer they must select at least one location to take a point of damage, the location can take more if the character so chooses. Should the Damage exceed the rating of the affected area any excess damage automatically cascades to lower layers. Should the area not have any rating left the attack affects the next layer up instead and cannot be cascaded. Example: Talak the poly human is ambushed by a dangerous Auto-fauna. Its attack deals STR3. Talak opts to cascade the damage distributing one point to his Structure reducing it to 1 and taking the rest on his Strike application reducing it to zero. He now only has one die to use for Structure rolls and cannot use the Strike Application until he recovers from the damage. . Other forms of Damage: There are times a character might take damage not from an attack such as from falling from a ledge, or being caught in a dangerous environment. In these instances the Admin will need to declare the needed roll(for example reaction to not fall) should they fail the character treats the failure as an attack equal to the amount of failures rolled that is targeted at the Root of the function. This may still be cascaded as with a normal attack however unless specifically stated armor will not be able to be used to reduce the damage. . Root Failure: When a character’s Roots are reduced to zero there is a risk of permanent damage. Characters that have their Frame reduced to zero will no longer be able to function physically; their bodies will have become too damaged and will need to be repaired in some manner or, they must transfer into a new frame. A character may opt to reduce their Chassis rating permanently to restore function, restructuring their bodies or losing non-functional components. A character that has had their Ghost reduced to Zero however faces far more trouble. They cannot Jaunt until they have at least one point restored and automatically fail any tests involving Personality or Process. Characters may however permanently reduce their Mass rating to restore functionality, restoring nervous function by forcing nerve growth via polymer and wetware components installed in their bodies. . The Battlefield: POLYMERGE does not use a tactical grid of Hex maps. Rather it uses Zones, these are abstracted zones that represent broad areas within the wilds of an Arcology. Most Zones are Approx. a quarter Kilometer in area though some might be larger or much smaller such as in the case of Indoor spaces. Zones are declared by the Admin at the start of Combat. There may be a number of Zones in the combat equal to the Current Depth. These are, unless otherwise stated to be equally connected. It should be noted some Zones will have special rules, effects or their own hazards. An Admin may only have so many Zones active at a time, this is typically tied to the current Depth At which the party’s at. Some Effects may persist even after combat such as Shelters, Accessways and docking stations. Below are examples of Basic types of Zones, these are also used during exploration these all are found at any Depth and on any planet. . Sprawl: It extends into the infinite, a mass of habitats, micro-stations and causeways. Sprawl was meant to house the bulk of the human species. Now it impedes their descendents. Characters fighting among Sprawl gain no distinct Advantage or disadvantages. Should a Weapon have the DEVASTATE ability at a rating higher than the current depth and generate enough Fumbles to exceed the Depth minus twelve the Sprawl is converted into a wreckage Zone at the start of the next Round. . Processing: The Arcologies are almost living things. Within them vast cannula channels waste and raw materials into churning processing systems themselves almost like living things as they draw in raw material and spit out refined items in endless monotony. Characters in Processing Zones are able to find useful materials more readily even in the throws of combat. They may spend an action to recover either Wetware, Hardware or Chymus. This may be done as many times as the current Depth. Processing areas are volatile, Chyme churns are well known for their flammable compounds and Cannula can simply burst into fragmented storms of materials and acidic matter. Characters that use a weapon that deals Energy Damage must be careful as should they generate any Faults; these are treated as Damage against all combatants in the field. . Catalysis: Raw material is pulled via ducts and arterials. Here the great Dray-fauna come to die, their bodies torn down to components as the Arcologies move in their all consuming growth. Catalysis zones are hives of activity and often crawling with Auto-fauna, sessile system points and all manner of scavengers picking them over for useful goods to trade at nearby settlements. Characters that spend an action within a Catalysis zone may roll Polymer if they do and generate a number of DRIVES equal the current depth minus ten they are able to locate a PASSIVE organoid of their choosing. . Junction: The ancient road and rail networks, once beautifully orchestrated in their precise movements, now are tangles of lines, starts and stops, stations and depots. These vast mazes serve often as shortcuts to those that know how to use them. However, those that do not often can find themselves lost beyond saving, forever wandering the Arcology wilds in a vain hope of finding a way out. If a combat ends with a Junction Zone still on the field a character may attempt to use it to find a shortcut. They may roll Power to activate the network and must generate a number of Success equal to the current depth. If successful they are able to select the next area they go to. . Substations: The massive amount of energy needed for the Arcologies to function is often spread across the structures. This distributed system of fusion furnaces, mantle taps and Solar plantations provides the basic energy needs of many areas. Substations act as routing points, providing mostly stable supplies of power throughout vast expanses of the wild Arcologies. Such areas often crackle with magnetic storms and plasma surges and can be hazardous to those that are not used to diving. At the start of each round characters must make a Reaction test equal to the current depth. If they are unable to, they suffer one point of damage to their structure but gain one point to their Power rating. Should this reduce their Structure below zero they immediately take their Power rating in damage to their Frame rating. . Wreckage: The battlefields of twenty-thousand years litter the solar system. Warden purges, Corpo-state battlefields and Arc-tribal disputes leave ruins in their wake. Wreckage fields are almost as common as Sprawl. Broken sections of Arcology bone exposing polymer rich marrow beneath as Autofauna slowly work away, destroying the ruin in their mindless state as they rebuild the endless megastructures. Characters moving through a Wreckage Zone must spend two actions to move through the area; however attacks at range suffer a -1D penalty due to the abundant cover. .",

            "title": "Creating a Character",
            "content": "Creating a Character: . Roots, Functions and Applications: . Characters in Polymerge are defined by their Roots, Functions and Applications. A character’s Roots Are what compose their core. Their Frame represents the inherent body that they currently inhabit, while their Ghost represents their mind. Functions represent a character’s basic abilities. A character with high Structure for instance will typically be robustly built and able to take substantial amounts of damage while a character with high process might be inclined to spend hours or days developing theorems of unique programs to use within the Wires. Applications are the last layer of a character and represent a character’s capabilities with specific tasks such as Shooting, Hacking or piloting Applications in addition can add in the associated Function. Additionally each layer is limited by the higher tier: A character may have up to 10 dice between their Root layer, their Functions can only be as high as their Root+2 and their Application ratings only as high as their Function. . Root: Frame and Ghost(D10): . The Frame and Ghost stats are the core of a character and represent their basic physical and mental capabilities. Consequently they are also the largest Dice. Most characters will have a rating of Frame and Ghost between 1 and 10. When a character uses either Ghost or Frame they must be careful as while they are capable of great feats of strength or mental fortitude they are also pushing themselves well beyond safe limits. Any Faults rolled are subtracted from the rating of the characters Ghost or Frame until they are able to reach a suitable location to rest and recover or if they have the appropriate resources to restore function. A Characters Roots are based upon which species they select at character creation. . Characters with high Frame are often quite large and intimidating, though characters with high end Organoids might be far more deceptive in appearance. Characters with Low Frame will often be fragile or even heavily simplified in form sporting little in terms of things like flesh or servos. . Characters with high Ghost are often deeply tied to their sense of self and are able to better retain their core personality through transitions into new bodies or jaunts through the Wires. Those with low Ghost are often simple minded and very literal. . Functions, the second layer(D8): . This is the Second layer of a character, functions cover the various ways in which a character interacts with the world of POLYMERGE. Functions are at character creation assigned three sets of values, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. These represent how adept at the outset a character is at a given function and also how much of the Root(either Ghost or Frame) is used for the initial Dice pool. Functions can be rated between 1-10. . Functions are used by default for most tests and as such when an Admin asks for a test they should declare which function it will be using first. A character’s Functions are determined by their Job. Primary: Use the whole value of the Root Secondary: use half the value of the Root Tertiary: use one quarter value of the Root(minimum 1) . Frame Functions: . Structure: . This function covers how durable a character is and how much force their Frame is able to exert. It is most often used in such actions as lifting heavy objects or determining melee damage. . Reaction: . This function covers the characters ability to react to such things as traps, incoming fire or noticing threats before they are clear and present. Reaction is also used to determine such things as ranged damage and accuracy and place in turn order during combat. . Power: . This function covers how long a character can operate before they need to recharge or rest, with the level of integration that Polymer brought everything within the Arcology needs a small amount of power to maintain their optimal functions. Power also covers how many Implants a character can use as well as if they are able to reactivate dormant systems such as lifts, and doors. . Ghost Functions: . Polymer: . This Function covers the use and control of Polymer and various Semi-organic systems such as Organoids. Polymer also represents how long a character can operate without needing to consume wetware, the catch all for the various soft tissues that are found in almost every advanced entity within the Arcologies. Polymer also determines the total amount of Organoids that a character can sustain as well as their ability to restore function to such things as Neural Clusters and dormant Auto-fauna. . Process: . Process covers cold analytical thinking. It is most often used by those that Jaunt into The Wires as they must write and rewrite code on the fly. Process is also used to determine how quickly actions can be taken within The Wires. . Personality: . Personality covers interactions with sentient beings. It is often used to convince someone that a character’s opinion is correct or that they are not a problem. Personality also is used to determine how many Proxies a character can manage at any given time. . Applications, (D6): . The third layer Apps cover more narrow and specific uses of a given function and add their rating into a roll. Apps can be thought of as similar to skills in many games. Apps also cannot Fault. Applications will always be damaged first in combat. When a character makes a test they must decide if they will use their Application Dice(if relevant to the test) they then will add in an amount of Dice equal to their Application rating to the Dice Pool before rolling. Sometimes a Test might state that a certain level with a given application might be needed. . Structure Applications: . Force: The Force application covers actions such as lifting heavy objects, unarmed melee strikes, wrestling a foe to the ground and the use of certain Organoids. . Resilience: Resilience covers the ability of a Frame to withstand damage, tolerate environmental hazards and how well it is able to move through the Arcologies. . Strike: The Strike Application covers the use of melee weapons whether handheld or Organoids ed. It also is used to determine the accuracy of unarmed strikes. . Reaction Applications: . Control: Control covers the use of fine motor skills in such actions as picking locks, building useful tools or installing Organoids into a body. . Targeting: Targeting covers the characters ability to accurately throw and shoot as well as their ability to notice hidden threats and important information. . Efficiency: This application covers the economy of motion of a character while navigating terrain, moving in combat and how rapidly a character can cover ground. . Power Applications: . Routing: Routing Covers the movement of energy between a character’s body, their Organoids s and external sources. . Generation: Generation covers how long a character can operate without the need for a charge, how strong a power surge they can create if needed and how much power they can output into a machine or similar piece of equipment. . Stability: Stability covers how much excess power can be stored for use and how well a character can handle such dangers as EM or some types of Polyrobe infection. . Polymer Applications: . Plasticity: This application covers a character’s ability to switch active organoids as well as integrate new ones into their body. . Symmetry: This application determines how long a character can maintain an active Implant, how well they can resist infectious Polyrobes as well as some environmental effects. . Propagation: This application covers how well a character can absorb polymer from wetware and organoids. Propagation also is used to help determine how long a character can go without needing wetware and is used when a character is creating polymer based items such as avatars. . Process Applications: . Computation: This is used for actions such as calculating a complex mathematical problem, plotting a course through unexplored Arcology and operating most types of Programs while in a Jaunt. . Threading: Threading covers the use of multiple programs during a jaunt, how quickly they can execute them and how changing active programs out. . Encryption: Encryption is used to determine how long a character can Jaunt safely, avoid detection and resist hacking attempts. Encryption is also used with some programs such as Firewalls to determine their effectiveness. . Personality Applications: . Protocol: This application covers gaining clearances, navigating millenia of bureaucracy and interacting with non-sentient wired entities. Protocol is also used with some programs. . Ego: Ego is used to resist mental attacks, appeal to a character’s humanity or exploit their emotional state. . Self: Self is used when characters transfer frames, Take over a Proxy or Avatar and tame such entities as Auto-fauna. . Derived Attributes: . Derived Attributes are determined at the start of Character creation and adjusted whenever a character rests within a Safe Zone. These represent static values and not fluid dice pools. When determining a Derived Value count each rank as one. . Charge: Power+Generation Charge determines the total number of Organoids that can be activated by a character. They may have more Organoids than Charge. . Mass: Polymer+Propagation Mass determines how many active organoids a character can have. A character cannot have more Organoids than their mass and for each point over their Mass will suffer a -1 success to any attempts to use their Organoids. . Chassis: Frame+Stability+Plasticity Chassis is the overall ability of a character to carry gear, materials and artifacts recovered when Diving. When a character exceeds their Chassis rating they suffer a -1D to all tests that have Frame as their Root. . Creating a Character: Inhabitants of the Post Zenith Solar system are varied. Many are scarcely what would be viewed as biologically human by us but, all stem from the same roots be it descended directly from humans as in the case of Poly-humanity or created by them such as the Synths and Autons. All know of the now extinct baseline humans, their names and forms often associated with a certain amount of mythology and respect. Often called Ancients, Bygones or just Them, baseline humanity has been extinct since before the Zenith and those that ascended into that Golden Age while outwardly similar were as different from their ancestors as the Solar systems current inhabitants are to them. To make a character in POLYMERGE, players must select a Species, a Job and Focus. These will help decide how mentally and physically resilient they are as well as their starting gear, favored functions and Applications. Players start at species, then select their role and finally Focus. Note players can also select a Faction if they so choose and have access to their unique Focuses but often there will be strings attached(Faction Focus will be later added). . The Inheritors: The Species of the Post-Zenith era are varied. Below we will talk about each in turn briefly and provide mechanical details for each such as their starting values for Ghost and Frame as well as any special rules they might have in addition to the normal rules as a character. . Autons: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Autons once were servants, now they live upon the myriad Arcologies that form the majority of habitable environments in the Solar System. Often tribal, these synthetic beings arose from various humanoid robots and semi-autonomous proxies that were left to their own devices as the Zenith ended. Autons often were descended from a specific type of chassis and even tens of thousands of years later still carry some of the key programming and structural keys of those early forms. An Auton character may upgrade one of the Following Applications automatically at character creation. If they would not normally have this App it instead is considered to be installed and starts at the normal value of D6. Application options: Strike, Targeting, Stability, Encryption, Protocol. . Polyhumans: Frame: 4 Ghost: 4 Polyhumanity are the most direct descendants from the Human species that lived during the Zenith. Their bodies are altered on fundamental levels from what we might view as purely biological but would not be out of place even among their ancestors in terms of outward appearance. Polyhumans are resourceful in the extreme, surviving from the fiery substrate of Mercury to the Ort. Polyhumans are capable of adapting to a host of environments thanks to thousands of years of exposure to Polyrobe cultures that altered their chemistry slightly, they also are quick to learn and adjust to new situations. Players that begin the game as Polyhumans may distribute four points between their Function ratings to a maximum amount of 5 in either value. . Synthetics: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Synthetic Andro-forms were meant to be the future for humanity, their bodies each a careful work of genetic architecture and the finest techno-organic engineering. Synthetics now however are a slowly dying breed, the complicated manufacturing needed to produce them has begun to fail and each successive run shows further drift from the original models of those ancient times. Synthetics may select either an Era or a Model ancestry. If they choose Model Ancestry they select an application from the Auton list. If they select Era they may choose one of the following options: Zenith Era: Stability is automatically a Secondary application, if it was already they instead add +1. Polymer is always treated as aTertiary function. Zenith Era Synths add +1 to their Structure Function. Quarantine era: Symmetry is automatically considered a Secondary Application, if it was already add +1. Personality is treated as always a Tertiary Function. Quarantine Era Synths add +1 to their Reaction Function. Modern Era: Efficiency is automatically considered a Secondary application, if it was already, add +1. Structure is always treated as a Tertiary Function. Modern Era Synths add +1 to their Personality Function. . Translated: Frame: 6 Ghost: 2 Changing Frames is far from a comfortable process. The various sensations that come with a new form, and indeed the need to adjust engrammatic data structures to new wetware often leaves an individual in a state of semi-psychosis without proper training and preparation. The Translated have long forgotten their original bodies, often having fled them thousands of years ago. Their largely Cybernetic forms allow for hardwearing forms though often at the cost of such things such as Empathy or an ability to register body language. Translated begin play +1 Organoids. However they cannot install Organoids during character creation. Should a Translated translate during play they may reroll any faults they have rolled in the process of doing so. Vestige: Translated often hold onto their past. Each translated begins with a personal vestige, a unique item that ties back to their former existence. So long as the translated has their vestige they can reroll one die of a Ghost Root or Function Test. However if the vestige is lost or destroyed they immediately lose one Die of Ghost as their tie to their former existence is severed. . Deserters: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Deserters fled the reality that was rapidly descending into a state of chaos and sheltered as translated minds within the rapidly changing environs of the Wires. Many Deserters are hostile to life within the ‘substrate’. However some venture into it either to flee the various rivalries and cannibalistic family ties of their tribe servers or to seek out a place to carve out their own territory far from competition. Deserters may begin play with either one additional Program or one additional Organoid. In addition should they Kill a Sentient Local they may either replace their Frame with the Locals OR may attempt to Incorporate their Ghost. They must roll a Vs. test against the Locals Ghost and may add one point(maximum of 6) per drive rolled on the test or for every 3DOS. . Wire Walkers: Frame: 2 Ghost: 6 Your ancestors fled into the Wire even as the plagues turned it into a chaotic maze. Their personalities live on through you, copied and blended together with not just other human minds but even the various AI entities that had lived during the Zenith. Within the Wires, you’re home. To venture to the Base reality runs risks but it must be done from time to time. Wire Walkers begin with two programs and may access the Wires automatically above a Depth equal to their Encryption Rating. . Jobs: Even into the Distant and strange future of Humanity past their Zenith those that survive still often need to make a living of some sort. Many of those that live in the Post-Zenith eke out meger livings, Poly-human and Auton tribes roam among the ruins of their ancestors hunting herds of autofauna using simple tools built from advanced machinery whose purpose is long forgotten, elsewhere Corpo-states rule their petty fiefdoms with iron fists and mandatory production quotas and Space-faring nomads sail between planets upon gravity currents hunting the pods of Cargo ships as they trace ancient travel corridors. The Jobs section covers the various roles that Divers might take on during play. These are broad categories that provide their Core Functions and some basic idea of their overall capabilities and equipment. Jobs are further defined by their Focus which provides starting Applications, potentially allied factions, standard Implants, organoids and programs. . Integrated: Primary Functions: Process,Power Or Polymer Secondary Functions: Polymer OR Power, Personality Tertiary Functions: Structure, Reaction. The integrated work to control the Arcologies and better survive them. Integrated are able to modify the bodies of themselves and others with a deft hand and tend to be adept in the knowledge needed to encode new organs, Organoids and even structures such as shelters. Integrated often need protection in combat. Starting Gear: Pistol, light armor, Basic Jaunt Organoid, Field Integrators kit. . Freelancer: Primary Functions: Structure, Reaction OR Personality Secondary Functions: Power, Polymer Tertiary Functions: Personality OR Reaction, Process Freelancers roam the Solar System providing a steady hand or sharp blade where there’s enough scrap and wetware to cover the cost of their time. Freelancers tend to be enigmatic, their lives taking them across entire Arcologies as they ply their trade and hunt down ancient relics. Starting Gear: Pistol, Rifle, medium armor, one basic Implant, one basic Organoid. . Soldiers: Primary Functions: Structure, Reaction OR Power. Secondary Functions: Process OR Personality, Polymer Tertiary Functions: Personality OR Process, Reaction OR Power Soldiers come from all across the Solar System, their martial prowess the result of varied methods to create a fighting force capable of handling all manner of threats. Soldiers that have become Divers tend to have lost their command structure and will seek out similar cultures or band together as mercenary forces. Starting gear: Rifle, heavy weapon(Chyron or Endisyte rifle), Medium Armor, One combat Implant or combat Organoid. . Porters: Primary Function: Reaction, Power OR Personality Secondary Function: Personality OR Power, Structure Tertiary Function: Process, Structure Porters roam the interiors of the Acrologies, cutting through ancient access ducts and arterial networks to reach far flung tribes or Corporate holdings using optimized trails. Porters travel far and wide, often being the only individuals outside of a settlement that are encountered for decades at a time. Starting gear: Pistol, light armor, Support rig, Nav Plug(X3). . Splicer: Primary Function: Process, Reaction OR Personality Secondary Functions: Power, Reaction OR personality Tertiary Functions: Structure, Polymer Splicers cut their way into the Wires, slipping through ancient backdoors in networks and carefully disabling feral sentry programs. Skilled Splicers are always in need of their ability to activate long dormant machine or create Auto-fauna lures often vital to settlements living deep in the Arcologies. Starting Gear: Pistol, Light armor, Basic Jaunt Organoid, Lurkers Implant. Backdoor(lvl1) . Scribners: Primary Functions: Process, Personality OR Polymer Secondary Functions: Personality OR Polymer, Power Tertiary Functions: Reaction, Structure Scribners often are sent to investigate crumbling registries left over by long dead corpo-states, the ruins of strange Arcology mutations or even the rumors of Zenith-era ships slumbering within the depths. Regardless, Scribners often must make their way across the Arcologies more with their wits than with a blade or bullet. Scribners can navigate the ancient bureaucratic tangle that often stymies others, allowing them to seek out and find shelter in times of trouble or halt an advancing foe with authentication errors. Starting Gear: Dagger, Light Armor, Authenticator organoid, Align(lvl1) . Focus: A character’s Focus determines their various applications, who they are tied to and some of their basic starting gear. Focuses are selected by players after they have taken their job. A character may select only Focus at the start of play but during play may opt to modify or switch their Focus. All applications and Programs begin play at level one. . Solar Nomad: Applications: Resilience, Efficiency. Routing, Propagation, Threading, Protocol Alliances: Wardens, Solar Nomads, Well Runners The Solar Nomads have survived upon the edge of the Solar system for millenia, the descendants of long-hauler batch crews that often were born within the confines of their self-sustaining vessels and have never left. Solar Nomads are known by many only from depictions in Plas-tapestries and Holo-stains that depict the Vacuusite wearing figures as enigmatic watchers from afar. The Wardens and Well Runners deal with them, often exchanging laser communications as they watch for Planula moving in the darkness of space or to warn of incoming fleets of predatory Corvettes such as Vespers. Starting Gear: Vacuusite organoid, Neural Interfacer(Vac. craft), Familial Prod-code. . Transcribist: Applications: Control, Routing, Symmetry, Computation, Encryption, Self Alliances: Wardens, Cults of the Conjugation The Transcribists seek to restore a semblance of order to the Wires. These brave souls dive into the chaos of Lesion networks and pluck out the mind-engrams of the infected in hopes of restoring their sense of self and sanity. Such work is not for the faint of heart as often the end result is deletion or storage within internal mem-drives as backups. The Transcribists seek out Wardens for their knowledge of Polymer Sickness, offering their skill with Jaunting as a means of payment for information on notable personality clusters. Others work with the Cults, hoping to reconstitute the minds of the infected via manipulating Polymer and by extension the disease itself. Starting gear: Neural Buffer organoid, Basic Jaunt Organoid Starting Programs: Extract(lvl1), Spoof(lvl1) . Wardens: Applications: Force, Strike, Efficiency, Generation, Symmetry, Ego. Alliances: Transcribists, Well Runners. The Wardens have fought against the Polymer Sickness since before the end of the Zenith. Their endless war has left scars that still linger to this day. Ancient cleansing fields where plasma torches were pointed downwards and allowed to burn out anything that they touched, glassed surfaces of Arcologies where Lesions once threatened to grow deep enough that they could not be scoured clean. It is a testament to their tenacity that only Earth fell to the disease. Wardens come from all walks of life or are built to the needs of the order, each fulfilling their mission to prevent the disease from spreading. Those that walk the path of a warden often work closely with Transcribists, their skill at Jaunting needed to reach ancient caches of technology or to locate dangerous infection zones, Well runners offer their ships in exchange for protection from boarding parties as they venture to the surface. Starting Gear: One Melee weapon, medium armor, One combat Organoids , 3x doses of Poly-stabil. . Scout, Warden: Applications:Strike,Targeting, Efficiency, Symmetry, Encryption, Ego. Alliances: Transcribists, Well Runners. The Wardens have made use of Scouts since their earliest days. These Advance guards often would infiltrate quarantined Blocks and set up the needed access routes for heavier forces to move in. Scouts typically are lightly armed and armored favoring either the ability to avoid detection or eliminate it before they’re noticed. Much like other Wardens they are known to deal with Transcribists and Well Runners often using them as key sources of intel as they seek out their targets. Starting gear: Rifle, Stealth Armor(light armor), Lurker Implant, Pheromone integrator Organoid. . Well-runner: Applications: Targeting, Control, Routing, Plasticity, Threading, Ego. Alliances: Solar Nomads, Wardens Well-runners race across the starfield, their vessels an extension of their bodies and minds sometimes in a very literal sense. These space faring wanderers differ from Nomads as they are not bound to family or ship. To each they are a captain of their own destiny and have been since the end of the Zenith, they and they alone decide their fate and should it be to die in a fiery explosion across the surface of a planetoid or torn to pieces by Interceptors on a run down the well, then so be it. Starting gear: Kaddis Class vessel, Pistol, Light armor, Neural Interfacer(Vac. Craft). . Corpo-Drone: Applications: Resilience, Efficiency, Stability, Symmetry, Protocol, Ego Alliances: Other Corpo-states, Wardens, Cults of the Conjugate To be a part of a Corpo-state is to know that you are within safe hands…so long as you meet your numbers for each Fiscal Annum. Corpo-Drones fill the roles that are beneath the various echelons of Supervisory nobility and power. Toiling away in File vaults and Cubicle towns. They are the backbone of the Corpo-states and are set to be the first sacrificed in its name. Starting Gear: Stun-stick, Identification Organoid(Own Corpo-state), Networker Implants. Starting Programs: Identify(lvl1) . Conjugate Cultist: Applications: Force, Efficiency, Generation, Plasticity, Propagation, Ego Alliances: Well-Runners, Arc-Tribes The Cults of the Conjugate flourish within the Post-Zenith. Their banners of three stripes flutter upon many warehouse settlements, a sign of loyalty to the new faith and its hopes to control the Polymer once more. To be a part of the Conjugate is to integrate oneself with the religion. Cultists often are not born but made, the germ line of monastic successors built with intent to spread the gospel of the New Flesh. Starting Gear: Identification Organoid(Cult facilities), Polymer catalyzer organoid, Indoctrination Architecture Starting Programs: Network(lvl1) . Conjugate Chorister: Applications: Control, Routing, Propagation, Symmetry, Encryption, Computation, Protocol. Alliances: Well-Runner, Arc-Tribes. Those that become Choristers often do so in hopes of gaining access to the great communion temples that sit in high orbit around Uranus. Such hopes are often in vain, and Choristers live out their days often attending their own node temple, ensuring network stability and that adherents of the faith are properly maintained. Those that venture forth however often find their skills were squandered. The ability to Harmonize the minds of those of the faithful alone can with a little adjustment be used to command terrifying Auto-fauna or convince foes they are allies. Starting Gear: Multi-jaunt organoid, Dermal cysting organoid. Starting programs: Extract(lvl1), Network(lvl2) . Arc-Tribal Applications: Resilience, Strike, Efficiency, Stability, Symmetry, Ego. Alliances: Wardens, Cults of the Conjugate. Your ancestors likely have lived within the same arcology since long before there was such a thing as Auto-fauna. Descended from maintenance staff, workers left as the Corporations fled to safety or even stranded fire-teams. Your people have survived in spite of the odds. Resourceful, clever and pragmatic, Arc-tribals often know little of the greater world and many refuse to believe such fanciful ideas as there being other planets. Starting Gear:Heavy melee weapon, Encrypt-totem .",

            "title": "Rules",
            "content": "POLYMERGE Rules V.01 . What this is: . POLYMERGE is a TTRPG/world inspired by the works of the likes of Tsumoto Nihei, Giger and countless others. This is a dark far future sci-fantasy world that takes place within our Solar System after it has been radically altered by mankind for thousands of years and then left to stagnate into a new dark age that has lasted for twenty-thousand years. In it players will adventure through Arcology Wilds, vast living cityscapes that grow and change of their own accord that have become inhabited by Auto-Fauna . Glossolalia: . Admin: The Game master, they adjudicate the various challenges that players will encounter as they explore the Solar System. . Diver: The player Character’s avatar in the Game World. Divers explore dangerous parts of the Solar System in hopes of finding ancient artifacts and riches. . Auto-fauna: The various non-sentient, animal-like machine organisms that inhabit the Solar system. Auto-fauna arose from the vehicles, devices and factories that Humanity had constructed during the Zenith, a previous golden age. . Polymer: A form of stable meta-material that was used to engineer the technology of the Zenith. In its raw state it has a pearlescent shine. . Polyrobe: a form of machine-organism that is microscopic in scale and was used for a wide array of purposes ranging from engineering to medicine. An uncontrolled strain of Polyrobe is responsible for the outbreak of Polymer Sickness. . Polymer Sickness: A disease that originated from a variety of polyrobe meant to terraform planets. It devastated the Solar System and ended the Zenith, a golden age. Polymer sickness is capable of rapidly and grotesquely mutating the hosts into drone bodies used to carry out the corrupted core programming of aggressive terraforming and Network setup. . Inheritors: The Various Species that arose after the Zenith which are descended from Humans or their creations. . Organoids: Various techno-organic implantable organs that are used for a wide array of purposes ranging from armor and weaponry to more utilitarian uses such as gaining access to secure sites or the Wires. . The Wires: Various now unstable networks that made up the information and economic systems of the Zenith era. Used by all manner of entities to ‘jaunt’ and gain access to information and data that might otherwise be lost. . Wetware: The semi-organic tissues that comprise much of the Post-zenith technology and life forms. Wetware is integrated through Polymer and can be consumed both for nutrition and to enhance organoids. . The Zenith: The era in which Humanity was able to engineer much of the technology that now runs rampant. The Zenith saw large-scale use of the resources of the Solar System and the start towards such things as Interstellar Travel and manipulation of fundamental forces such as gravity. The setting of Polymerge is set over twenty-thousand years after the end of the Zenith after Polymer-Sickness destroyed that society and its infrastructure. . How to play: . Polymerge uses an assortment of polyhedral dice that are rolled to perform various tasks such as escaping parties of Deserters, fighting off dangerous Auto-fauna or using the The Wires. Characters will use different sized dice depending upon factors such as available applications, damage status and Organoids are used. Below is not only the various parts of a character but also the die that is used with it. . Determining Success: . When characters roll Dice they must count the total number of Successes, Failures, Drives and Faults that are rolled during play. Successes are any die result that is greater than 4+ on the die; these count towards overcoming the current challenge. There are times that Drives must be counted, Drives are any result that is 8+ certain abilities require an amount of Drives to be rolled before they can be used. . Failures count against Success and are any result that is 3 or less, if there is more failure than success the character is considered to have failed their task. Sometimes characters will need to note any Faults rolled; these are results of 1 on the die and can have various negative impacts on the outcome of a test. . Tests: . Characters will need to periodically perform a variety of tasks. The Admin will inform the players of the Appropriate Function needed for the test or let them decide and assign it a difficulty. . Players that generate enough successes to Meet or Exceed the test are considered to have passed it. Sometimes such as in combat, constructing items or Recovering functions players will need to determine the Degree of Success(DOS). To do so simply subtract the result from the test. The remainder is the DOS. . Characters that have not generated enough successes to meet or exceed the test are considered to have failed the test. At times there will be a need to determine the Degree of Failure(DOF). Subtract the total number of Failures from the Test the remainder is the DOF. . Assembling the Dice Pool: . When a character in POLYMERGE makes a test they will need to select the appropriate dice to use for their chosen course of action. The base of any Die Pool will be either one of the various Functions a character has or more rarely their Root. The Admin will need to declare the appropriate Function needed for the test. Should they not declare a Function they must instead declare which Root will be needed. Note: Should an Admin ask for a Root as the base for a test character cannot generate Either Faults or Drives. . Once the base Function or Root has been declared the character selects a number of dice equal to their Rating in that Function. (Examples of suitable Functions to tasks include Shooting a target using Reaction, navigating a hazardous network node using Process and convincing a Corpo-state Guard to turn a blind eye to not having the correct paperwork using Personality). Characters may then select the appropriate Application if they have one, as well as any suitable Organoids, programs or gear as well as adding the various bonuses they have to the Pool. Once they have this assembled there is a final option of using the Function’s Root(Ghost or Frame) to . Upgrade the selected Function. Players that choose to so must Expend a number of Points in the chosen Root and temporarily reduce the Rating of the Function by that much. They may then Upgrade a number of dice from the Function to the same size as their Root. They may only do this as many times as they have rating in their Root. Should they Expend enough of their rating to reduce it to Zero a character may also no longer Cascade their Damage. Example: Steve’s character Tacheck is currently trying to scale an unstable section of arcology. The Admin Nick states that to cross safely, he will need to roll Reaction, a Function. However, Tacheck doesn’t have Reaction he instead must use his Root which is Frame . Versus Tests: . There will be times characters will come into direct competition with each other. In these situations characters will need to perform a Versus test. These will most typically be used during Combat. To determine the winner of a Versus test, whichever character has generated more net successes is considered the winner. At times the Admin will need to declare a certain minimum amount of successes needed to complete a task(such as a competition of skill or a race). Those that beat the test are considered to have succeeded but the winner is still determined by the net amount of success or, in the event of a tie, the amount of Drives rolled. . In the event neither party is able to generate enough success, the character with the lowest amount of Failure or in the event of a tie, Faults is treated as the winner. . Example: Steve’s Character Tachek is in a heated debate with a Warden over gaining access to a quarantine. The Admin Nick states that Tachek can gain access if they can convince the Warden to let them in. Steve agrees and assembles his Dice in this case he uses the Application Ego which grants him 2d6 plus the 3d8 from the Function Personality. He rolls against the 2d8 that the Warden has in Personality, easily convincing them to let them through. . Extended Tests: . Characters at times might need to generate enough success over the course of several tests to complete a task. This is typically used during Jaunts into the Wires or crafting items. To determine success the character may roll the relevant Function. If they have Applications that might be useful they can also apply them as an automatic success to the test. The character must either Add one success per drive rolled OR add the total amount of successes and failures to the test. . A character may take an extended test as many times as the rating of their relevant Function.(So a character with Process rated at 2 may attempt a Process related extended test twice). Should a character generate enough success that they meet or exceed the required amount they are considered Successful. DOS will not factor unless stated otherwise. However, if a character generated enough failure to exceed the test requirements they are considered to have failed the test and may not redo it. . The Character: . Roots, Functions and Applications: . Characters in Polymerge are defined by their Roots, Functions and Applications. A character’s Roots Are what compose their core. Their Frame represents the inherent body that they currently inhabit, while their Ghost represents their mind. Functions represent a character’s basic abilities. A character with high Structure for instance will typically be robustly built and able to take substantial amounts of damage while a character with high process might be inclined to spend hours or days developing theorems of unique programs to use within the Wires. Applications are the last layer of a character and represent a character’s capabilities with specific tasks such as Shooting, Hacking or piloting Applications in addition can add in the associated Function. Additionally each layer is limited by the higher tier: A character may have up to 10 dice between their Root layer, their Functions can only be as high as their Root+2 and their Application ratings only as high as their Function. . Root: Frame and Ghost(D10): . The Frame and Ghost stats are the core of a character and represent their basic physical and mental capabilities. Consequently they are also the largest Dice. Most characters will have a rating of Frame and Ghost between 1 and 10. When a character uses either Ghost or Frame they must be careful as while they are capable of great feats of strength or mental fortitude they are also pushing themselves well beyond safe limits. Any Faults rolled are subtracted from the rating of the characters Ghost or Frame until they are able to reach a suitable location to rest and recover or if they have the appropriate resources to restore function. A Characters Roots are based upon which species they select at character creation. . Characters with high Frame are often quite large and intimidating, though characters with high end Organoids might be far more deceptive in appearance. Characters with Low Frame will often be fragile or even heavily simplified in form sporting little in terms of things like flesh or servos. . Characters with high Ghost are often deeply tied to their sense of self and are able to better retain their core personality through transitions into new bodies or jaunts through the Wires. Those with low Ghost are often simple minded and very literal. . Functions, the second layer(D8): . This is the Second layer of a character, functions cover the various ways in which a character interacts with the world of POLYMERGE. Functions are at character creation assigned three sets of values, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. These represent how adept at the outset a character is at a given function and also how much of the Root(either Ghost or Frame) is used for the initial Dice pool. Functions can be rated between 1-10. . Functions are used by default for most tests and as such when an Admin asks for a test they should declare which function it will be using first. A character’s Functions are determined by their Job. Primary: Use the whole value of the Root Secondary: use half the value of the Root Tertiary: use one quarter value of the Root(minimum 1) . Frame Functions: . Structure: . This function covers how durable a character is and how much force their Frame is able to exert. It is most often used in such actions as lifting heavy objects or determining melee damage. . Reaction: . This function covers the characters ability to react to such things as traps, incoming fire or noticing threats before they are clear and present. Reaction is also used to determine such things as ranged damage and accuracy and place in turn order during combat. . Power: . This function covers how long a character can operate before they need to recharge or rest, with the level of integration that Polymer brought everything within the Arcology needs a small amount of power to maintain their optimal functions. Power also covers how many Implants a character can use as well as if they are able to reactivate dormant systems such as lifts, and doors. . Ghost Functions: . Polymer: . This Function covers the use and control of Polymer and various Semi-organic systems such as Organoids. Polymer also represents how long a character can operate without needing to consume wetware, the catch all for the various soft tissues that are found in almost every advanced entity within the Arcologies. Polymer also determines the total amount of Organoids that a character can sustain as well as their ability to restore function to such things as Neural Clusters and dormant Auto-fauna. . Process: . Process covers cold analytical thinking. It is most often used by those that Jaunt into The Wires as they must write and rewrite code on the fly. Process is also used to determine how quickly actions can be taken within The Wires. . Personality: . Personality covers interactions with sentient beings. It is often used to convince someone that a character’s opinion is correct or that they are not a problem. Personality also is used to determine how many Proxies a character can manage at any given time. . Applications, (D6): The third layer Apps cover more narrow and specific uses of a given function and add their rating into a roll. Apps can be thought of as similar to skills in many games. Apps also cannot Fault. Applications will always be damaged first in combat. When a character makes a test they must decide if they will use their Application Dice(if relevant to the test) they then will add in an amount of Dice equal to their Application rating to the Dice Pool before rolling. Sometimes a Test might state that a certain level with a given application might be needed. . Structure Applications: Force: The Force application covers actions such as lifting heavy objects, unarmed melee strikes, wrestling a foe to the ground and the use of certain Organoids. . Resilience: Resilience covers the ability of a Frame to withstand damage, tolerate environmental hazards and how well it is able to move through the Arcologies. . Strike: The Strike Application covers the use of melee weapons whether handheld or Organoids ed. It also is used to determine the accuracy of unarmed strikes. . Reaction Applications: Control: Control covers the use of fine motor skills in such actions as picking locks, building useful tools or installing Organoids into a body. . Targeting: Targeting covers the characters ability to accurately throw and shoot as well as their ability to notice hidden threats and important information. . Efficiency: This application covers the economy of motion of a character while navigating terrain, moving in combat and how rapidly a character can cover ground. . Power Applications: Routing: Routing Covers the movement of energy between a character’s body, their Organoids s and external sources. . Generation: Generation covers how long a character can operate without the need for a charge, how strong a power surge they can create if needed and how much power they can output into a machine or similar piece of equipment. . Stability: Stability covers how much excess power can be stored for use and how well a character can handle such dangers as EM or some types of Polyrobe infection. . Polymer Applications: Plasticity: This application covers a character’s ability to switch active organoids as well as integrate new ones into their body. . Symmetry: This application determines how long a character can maintain an active Implant, how well they can resist infectious Polyrobes as well as some environmental effects. . Propagation: This application covers how well a character can absorb polymer from wetware and organoids. Propagation also is used to help determine how long a character can go without needing wetware and is used when a character is creating polymer based items such as avatars. . Process Applications: Computation: This is used for actions such as calculating a complex mathematical problem, plotting a course through unexplored Arcology and operating most types of Programs while in a Jaunt. . Threading: Threading covers the use of multiple programs during a jaunt, how quickly they can execute them and how changing active programs out. . Encryption: Encryption is used to determine how long a character can Jaunt safely, avoid detection and resist hacking attempts. Encryption is also used with some programs such as Firewalls to determine their effectiveness. . Personality Applications: Protocol: This application covers gaining clearances, navigating millenia of bureaucracy and interacting with non-sentient wired entities. Protocol is also used with some programs. . Ego: Ego is used to resist mental attacks, appeal to a character’s humanity or exploit their emotional state. . Self: Self is used when characters transfer frames, Take over a Proxy or Avatar and tame such entities as Auto-fauna. . Derived Attributes: Derived Attributes are determined at the start of Character creation and adjusted whenever a character rests within a Safe Zone. These represent static values and not fluid dice pools. When determining a Derived Value count each rank as one. . Charge: Power+Generation Charge determines the total number of Organoids that can be activated by a character. They may have more Organoids than Charge. . Mass: Polymer+Propagation Mass determines how many active organoids a character can have. A character cannot have more Organoids than their mass and for each point over their Mass will suffer a -1 success to any attempts to use their Organoids. . Chassis: Frame+Stability+Plasticity Chassis is the overall ability of a character to carry gear, materials and artifacts recovered when Diving. When a character exceeds their Chassis rating they suffer a -1D to all tests that have Frame as their Root. . Creating a Character: Inhabitants of the Post Zenith Solar system are varied. Many are scarcely what would be viewed as biologically human by us but, all stem from the same roots be it descended directly from humans as in the case of Poly-humanity or created by them such as the Synths and Autons. All know of the now extinct baseline humans, their names and forms often associated with a certain amount of mythology and respect. Often called Ancients, Bygones or just Them, baseline humanity has been extinct since before the Zenith and those that ascended into that Golden Age while outwardly similar were as different from their ancestors as the Solar systems current inhabitants are to them. To make a character in POLYMERGE, players must select a Species, a Job and Focus. These will help decide how mentally and physically resilient they are as well as their starting gear, favored functions and Applications. Players start at species, then select their role and finally Focus. Note players can also select a Faction if they so choose and have access to their unique Focuses but often there will be strings attached(Faction Focus will be later added). . The Inheritors: The Species of the Post-Zenith era are varied. Below we will talk about each in turn briefly and provide mechanical details for each such as their starting values for Ghost and Frame as well as any special rules they might have in addition to the normal rules as a character. . Autons: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Autons once were servants, now they live upon the myriad Arcologies that form the majority of habitable environments in the Solar System. Often tribal, these synthetic beings arose from various humanoid robots and semi-autonomous proxies that were left to their own devices as the Zenith ended. Autons often were descended from a specific type of chassis and even tens of thousands of years later still carry some of the key programming and structural keys of those early forms. An Auton character may upgrade one of the Following Applications automatically at character creation. If they would not normally have this App it instead is considered to be installed and starts at the normal value of D6. Application options: Strike, Targeting, Stability, Encryption, Protocol. . Polyhumans: Frame: 4 Ghost: 4 Polyhumanity are the most direct descendants from the Human species that lived during the Zenith. Their bodies are altered on fundamental levels from what we might view as purely biological but would not be out of place even among their ancestors in terms of outward appearance. Polyhumans are resourceful in the extreme, surviving from the fiery substrate of Mercury to the Ort. Polyhumans are capable of adapting to a host of environments thanks to thousands of years of exposure to Polyrobe cultures that altered their chemistry slightly, they also are quick to learn and adjust to new situations. Players that begin the game as Polyhumans may distribute four points between their Function ratings to a maximum amount of 5 in either value. . Synthetics: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Synthetic Andro-forms were meant to be the future for humanity, their bodies each a careful work of genetic architecture and the finest techno-organic engineering. Synthetics now however are a slowly dying breed, the complicated manufacturing needed to produce them has begun to fail and each successive run shows further drift from the original models of those ancient times. Synthetics may select either an Era or a Model ancestry. If they choose Model Ancestry they select an application from the Auton list. If they select Era they may choose one of the following options: Zenith Era: Stability is automatically a Secondary application, if it was already they instead add +1. Polymer is always treated as aTertiary function. Zenith Era Synths add +1 to their Structure Function. Quarantine era: Symmetry is automatically considered a Secondary Application, if it was already add +1. Personality is treated as always a Tertiary Function. Quarantine Era Synths add +1 to their Reaction Function. Modern Era: Efficiency is automatically considered a Secondary application, if it was already, add +1. Structure is always treated as a Tertiary Function. Modern Era Synths add +1 to their Personality Function. . Translated: Frame: 6 Ghost: 2 Changing Frames is far from a comfortable process. The various sensations that come with a new form, and indeed the need to adjust engrammatic data structures to new wetware often leaves an individual in a state of semi-psychosis without proper training and preparation. The Translated have long forgotten their original bodies, often having fled them thousands of years ago. Their largely Cybernetic forms allow for hardwearing forms though often at the cost of such things such as Empathy or an ability to register body language. Translated begin play +1 Organoids. However they cannot install Organoids during character creation. Should a Translated translate during play they may reroll any faults they have rolled in the process of doing so. Vestige: Translated often hold onto their past. Each translated begins with a personal vestige, a unique item that ties back to their former existence. So long as the translated has their vestige they can reroll one die of a Ghost Root or Function Test. However if the vestige is lost or destroyed they immediately lose one Die of Ghost as their tie to their former existence is severed. . Deserters: Frame: 5 Ghost: 3 Deserters fled the reality that was rapidly descending into a state of chaos and sheltered as translated minds within the rapidly changing environs of the Wires. Many Deserters are hostile to life within the ‘substrate’. However some venture into it either to flee the various rivalries and cannibalistic family ties of their tribe servers or to seek out a place to carve out their own territory far from competition. Deserters may begin play with either one additional Program or one additional Organoid. In addition should they Kill a Sentient Local they may either replace their Frame with the Locals OR may attempt to Incorporate their Ghost. They must roll a Vs. test against the Locals Ghost and may add one point(maximum of 6) per drive rolled on the test or for every 3DOS. . Wire Walkers: Frame: 2 Ghost: 6 Your ancestors fled into the Wire even as the plagues turned it into a chaotic maze. Their personalities live on through you, copied and blended together with not just other human minds but even the various AI entities that had lived during the Zenith. Within the Wires, you’re home. To venture to the Base reality runs risks but it must be done from time to time. Wire Walkers begin with two programs and may access the Wires automatically above a Depth equal to their Encryption Rating. . Jobs: Even into the Distant and strange future of Humanity past their Zenith those that survive still often need to make a living of some sort. Many of those that live in the Post-Zenith eke out meger livings, Poly-human and Auton tribes roam among the ruins of their ancestors hunting herds of autofauna using simple tools built from advanced machinery whose purpose is long forgotten, elsewhere Corpo-states rule their petty fiefdoms with iron fists and mandatory production quotas and Space-faring nomads sail between planets upon gravity currents hunting the pods of Cargo ships as they trace ancient travel corridors. The Jobs section covers the various roles that Divers might take on during play. These are broad categories that provide their Core Functions and some basic idea of their overall capabilities and equipment. Jobs are further defined by their Focus which provides starting Applications, potentially allied factions, standard Implants, organoids and programs. . Integrated: Primary Functions: Process,Power Or Polymer Secondary Functions: Polymer OR Power, Personality Tertiary Functions: Structure, Reaction. The integrated work to control the Arcologies and better survive them. Integrated are able to modify the bodies of themselves and others with a deft hand and tend to be adept in the knowledge needed to encode new organs, Organoids and even structures such as shelters. Integrated often need protection in combat. Starting Gear: Pistol, light armor, Basic Jaunt Organoid, Field Integrators kit. . Freelancer: Primary Functions: Structure, Reaction OR Personality Secondary Functions: Power, Polymer Tertiary Functions: Personality OR Reaction, Process Freelancers roam the Solar System providing a steady hand or sharp blade where there’s enough scrap and wetware to cover the cost of their time. Freelancers tend to be enigmatic, their lives taking them across entire Arcologies as they ply their trade and hunt down ancient relics. Starting Gear: Pistol, Rifle, medium armor, one basic Implant, one basic Organoid. . Soldiers: Primary Functions: Structure, Reaction OR Power. Secondary Functions: Process OR Personality, Polymer Tertiary Functions: Personality OR Process, Reaction OR Power Soldiers come from all across the Solar System, their martial prowess the result of varied methods to create a fighting force capable of handling all manner of threats. Soldiers that have become Divers tend to have lost their command structure and will seek out similar cultures or band together as mercenary forces. Starting gear: Rifle, heavy weapon(Chyron or Endisyte rifle), Medium Armor, One combat Implant or combat Organoid. . Porters: Primary Function: Reaction, Power OR Personality Secondary Function: Personality OR Power, Structure Tertiary Function: Process, Structure Porters roam the interiors of the Acrologies, cutting through ancient access ducts and arterial networks to reach far flung tribes or Corporate holdings using optimized trails. Porters travel far and wide, often being the only individuals outside of a settlement that are encountered for decades at a time. Starting gear: Pistol, light armor, Support rig, Nav Plug(X3). . Splicer: Primary Function: Process, Reaction OR Personality Secondary Functions: Power, Reaction OR personality Tertiary Functions: Structure, Polymer Splicers cut their way into the Wires, slipping through ancient backdoors in networks and carefully disabling feral sentry programs. Skilled Splicers are always in need of their ability to activate long dormant machine or create Auto-fauna lures often vital to settlements living deep in the Arcologies. Starting Gear: Pistol, Light armor, Basic Jaunt Organoid, Lurkers Implant. Backdoor(lvl1) . Scribners: Primary Functions: Process, Personality OR Polymer Secondary Functions: Personality OR Polymer, Power Tertiary Functions: Reaction, Structure Scribners often are sent to investigate crumbling registries left over by long dead corpo-states, the ruins of strange Arcology mutations or even the rumors of Zenith-era ships slumbering within the depths. Regardless, Scribners often must make their way across the Arcologies more with their wits than with a blade or bullet. Scribners can navigate the ancient bureaucratic tangle that often stymies others, allowing them to seek out and find shelter in times of trouble or halt an advancing foe with authentication errors. Starting Gear: Dagger, Light Armor, Authenticator organoid, Align(lvl1) . Focus: A character’s Focus determines their various applications, who they are tied to and some of their basic starting gear. Focuses are selected by players after they have taken their job. A character may select only Focus at the start of play but during play may opt to modify or switch their Focus. All applications and Programs begin play at level one. . Solar Nomad: Applications: Resilience, Efficiency. Routing, Propagation, Threading, Protocol Alliances: Wardens, Solar Nomads, Well Runners The Solar Nomads have survived upon the edge of the Solar system for millenia, the descendants of long-hauler batch crews that often were born within the confines of their self-sustaining vessels and have never left. Solar Nomads are known by many only from depictions in Plas-tapestries and Holo-stains that depict the Vacuusite wearing figures as enigmatic watchers from afar. The Wardens and Well Runners deal with them, often exchanging laser communications as they watch for Planula moving in the darkness of space or to warn of incoming fleets of predatory Corvettes such as Vespers. Starting Gear: Vacuusite organoid, Neural Interfacer(Vac. craft), Familial Prod-code. . Transcribist: Applications: Control, Routing, Symmetry, Computation, Encryption, Self Alliances: Wardens, Cults of the Conjugation The Transcribists seek to restore a semblance of order to the Wires. These brave souls dive into the chaos of Lesion networks and pluck out the mind-engrams of the infected in hopes of restoring their sense of self and sanity. Such work is not for the faint of heart as often the end result is deletion or storage within internal mem-drives as backups. The Transcribists seek out Wardens for their knowledge of Polymer Sickness, offering their skill with Jaunting as a means of payment for information on notable personality clusters. Others work with the Cults, hoping to reconstitute the minds of the infected via manipulating Polymer and by extension the disease itself. Starting gear: Neural Buffer organoid, Basic Jaunt Organoid Starting Programs: Extract(lvl1), Spoof(lvl1) . Wardens: Applications: Force, Strike, Efficiency, Generation, Symmetry, Ego. Alliances: Transcribists, Well Runners. The Wardens have fought against the Polymer Sickness since before the end of the Zenith. Their endless war has left scars that still linger to this day. Ancient cleansing fields where plasma torches were pointed downwards and allowed to burn out anything that they touched, glassed surfaces of Arcologies where Lesions once threatened to grow deep enough that they could not be scoured clean. It is a testament to their tenacity that only Earth fell to the disease. Wardens come from all walks of life or are built to the needs of the order, each fulfilling their mission to prevent the disease from spreading. Those that walk the path of a warden often work closely with Transcribists, their skill at Jaunting needed to reach ancient caches of technology or to locate dangerous infection zones, Well runners offer their ships in exchange for protection from boarding parties as they venture to the surface. Starting Gear: One Melee weapon, medium armor, One combat Organoids , 3x doses of Poly-stabil. . Scout, Warden: Applications:Strike,Targeting, Efficiency, Symmetry, Encryption, Ego. Alliances: Transcribists, Well Runners. The Wardens have made use of Scouts since their earliest days. These Advance guards often would infiltrate quarantined Blocks and set up the needed access routes for heavier forces to move in. Scouts typically are lightly armed and armored favoring either the ability to avoid detection or eliminate it before they’re noticed. Much like other Wardens they are known to deal with Transcribists and Well Runners often using them as key sources of intel as they seek out their targets. Starting gear: Rifle, Stealth Armor(light armor), Lurker Implant, Pheromone integrator Organoid. . Well-runner: Applications: Targeting, Control, Routing, Plasticity, Threading, Ego. Alliances: Solar Nomads, Wardens Well-runners race across the starfield, their vessels an extension of their bodies and minds sometimes in a very literal sense. These space faring wanderers differ from Nomads as they are not bound to family or ship. To each they are a captain of their own destiny and have been since the end of the Zenith, they and they alone decide their fate and should it be to die in a fiery explosion across the surface of a planetoid or torn to pieces by Interceptors on a run down the well, then so be it. Starting gear: Kaddis Class vessel, Pistol, Light armor, Neural Interfacer(Vac. Craft). . Corpo-Drone: Applications: Resilience, Efficiency, Stability, Symmetry, Protocol, Ego Alliances: Other Corpo-states, Wardens, Cults of the Conjugate To be a part of a Corpo-state is to know that you are within safe hands…so long as you meet your numbers for each Fiscal Annum. Corpo-Drones fill the roles that are beneath the various echelons of Supervisory nobility and power. Toiling away in File vaults and Cubicle towns. They are the backbone of the Corpo-states and are set to be the first sacrificed in its name. Starting Gear: Stun-stick, Identification Organoid(Own Corpo-state), Networker Implants. Starting Programs: Identify(lvl1) . Conjugate Cultist: Applications: Force, Efficiency, Generation, Plasticity, Propagation, Ego Alliances: Well-Runners, Arc-Tribes The Cults of the Conjugate flourish within the Post-Zenith. Their banners of three stripes flutter upon many warehouse settlements, a sign of loyalty to the new faith and its hopes to control the Polymer once more. To be a part of the Conjugate is to integrate oneself with the religion. Cultists often are not born but made, the germ line of monastic successors built with intent to spread the gospel of the New Flesh. Starting Gear: Identification Organoid(Cult facilities), Polymer catalyzer organoid, Indoctrination Architecture Starting Programs: Network(lvl1) . Conjugate Chorister: Applications: Control, Routing, Propagation, Symmetry, Encryption, Computation, Protocol. Alliances: Well-Runner, Arc-Tribes. Those that become Choristers often do so in hopes of gaining access to the great communion temples that sit in high orbit around Uranus. Such hopes are often in vain, and Choristers live out their days often attending their own node temple, ensuring network stability and that adherents of the faith are properly maintained. Those that venture forth however often find their skills were squandered. The ability to Harmonize the minds of those of the faithful alone can with a little adjustment be used to command terrifying Auto-fauna or convince foes they are allies. Starting Gear: Multi-jaunt organoid, Dermal cysting organoid. Starting programs: Extract(lvl1), Network(lvl2) . Arc-Tribal Applications: Resilience, Strike, Efficiency, Stability, Symmetry, Ego. Alliances: Wardens, Cults of the Conjugate. Your ancestors likely have lived within the same arcology since long before there was such a thing as Auto-fauna. Descended from maintenance staff, workers left as the Corporations fled to safety or even stranded fire-teams. Your people have survived in spite of the odds. Resourceful, clever and pragmatic, Arc-tribals often know little of the greater world and many refuse to believe such fanciful ideas as there being other planets. Starting Gear:Heavy melee weapon, Encrypt-totem . Exploring the Solar System: From the Sweltering Furnace plains of Mercury to the frozen ruins of ancient orbital platforms in the distant Ort lit only by the light of a billion distant stars, humanity spread to the far corners of its home system and once were tightly knit together. But that was then, this is now. Much of the of the vast wild arcologies that dominate the Solar System twenty thousand years after the Zenith are inhospitable and unexplored. Ancient ruins lay buried beneath layers of urban jungle and tangles of processing facilities and pipelines that route vital resources through them. . Those that brave such places often do so carrying only what they can, forming small expeditions into the Depths that rely as much on what’s available as what they can bring in. Characters that players control in POLYMERGE are known as Divers. They venture into the vast expanses of Wild Arcology often risking life and limb to retrieve vital resources or components for the small settlements of Polyhumans that dot the Solar system or at the behest of one of the various factions that has since arose in the absence of The Concordant and other powers of the Zenith. . Down the Well: Divers will need to prepare before they venture out. If they are starting their first session they are assumed to have everything they need. The party begins with one portable shelter, one powercell per player and ammunition for any weapons that have the AMMO trait. . Going Down: Divers will need to be wary of how deep into the various Arcologies they go, all manner of dangers lurk within the depths from crumbling Fusion Furnace that lash out for kilometers around them with vast arcs of energized plasma vortices to Auto-fauna reclimators that skulk in the depths dismantling the unwary to reclaim Wetware for use within their Factory hives. When players first reach an Arcology they must choose their landing sight. A diver is nominated to roll a reaction test(players may also have other means to descend but typically will do so via a drop ship or similar means) and then consult the table below to see the end result. There will be times when the Divers might not need a roll(such as access to an orbital elevator or Quanta tunnel) these will be detailed later. . Reaction roll successes/failures: Effect on landing 3+ Faults Catastrophic crash: The dive team slams into the surface of the arcology, leaving a wake of debris, wreckage in their path. They begin the session within a Wreckage field Zone and immediately take a hit to their Frame equal to the amount of faults rolled. 3+ failure Crash: The Dive team will need to find another way back out of the Arcology. They immediately take D3 Frame Damage and begin their expedition within a Wreckage Field Zone. 1+ successes Landed: The Dive team has landed without incident and proceed as normal. 3+ successes Planned landing: The Dive team selects an optimal site for their landing, reroll the starting Zone hex. 2+ Drives Choice landing: The Dive team has selected the perfect spot. The Pilot may select the starting Zone. . The Travel Phase: Dive Teams are expected to explore the Arcology wilderness. To help create a flow of events that is not jarring this is called the Exploration phase and operates in some ways similar to combat. Each ‘Round’ of exploration the Dive Team will select which Zone they wish to explore or move into. During the Travel phase a Dive Team may do the following: Move, Explore, Rest and breach. To perform these actions the Dive team must be willing to expend dice. When the Travel Phase begins each player at the Table(NPCS) included must select either an Application or a Function die and Expend it, reducing their roll with that associated function or application until they are able to reach a place to repair and recover. Not every player must select the same action with the exception of Move and with Breach. As these will result in the team moving in a new Zone. . Move: The Dive team moves from one zone to another revealing what it is. They Roll the highest Die that was Expended and Consult the Zone Table. . Explore: The Dive Team searches their surroundings. Each diver that opted to Explore this round may roll their expended Die however the Highest result will be the outcome. Should there be any ties add +1 for each tie. Should the team encounter something dangerous only those players that rolled to explore will be considered to be in danger. . Rest: The team repairs and recovers, seeking shelter. This Costs no dice to perform however if none are expended each player may only use one item and recover one Die that has been expended. If a player Expends a Die each other Diver on the Team(and themselves included) the party then instead may take that many actions/recover that many Dice that have been expended+1. . Breach: The Dive Team attempts to move deeper into the Arcology, increasing the depth they are currently at. All players must agree to this. To Attempt a Breach roll the lowest expended die and add any relevant modifiers such as organoids, ties and access nodes that have been collected. If the result is higher than twice the current Depth the players are able to proceed deeper. . Zones: Zones much like in battle are large areas that a group of Divers will explore to find lost artifacts, ancient corporate vaults or collections of various Inheritors living out their lives within the Arcology wilds. Each Time the Dive team moves they will encounter a new Zone(see moving). Zones can have their own unique locations and events associated with them. When a team moves into a new zone the admin will reveal what it is as well as any associated events that are triggered by them entering the area. . Locals: Natives, be they friendly or hostile, are known as locals. Each planet is host to various distinct tribes and factions that operate within them. How the divers wish to handle them is up to them. Locals can be played immediately or saved for later by either the players or the Admin. The number next to Locals shows how likely that on a given roll they will be encountered as well as the most common type and their disposition. Hostiles: The Arcologies are rife with Danger. When characters roll the number(s) in the Hostiles entry during Exploration they have encountered a group of dangerous enemies. Each number will have an associated type of foe next to it such as Auto-fauna, Hostile Dive Teams or Polymer Sickness drones. . Materials: Ancient relics, caches of Sessile wetware and power supplies. Materials are often what Divers are after the most. Materials can be held in hand or used immediately for their effects. Materials will also have a value listed Chyme, the fluid that backs many currencies and is harvested from Arcologies for building many items. Materials can be sold in friendly settlements or even to ancient auto-vends that lay dormant kilometers down. Materials will typically be found by entering into ruined locations or trading with the locals. Most material is traded back in orbit for Chyme. . Points of interest: Points of Interest are smaller than entire Zones, ancient Commercial centers, factors and shelters all fall within the category as do more dangerous things such as automated processing houses, reclamator hives and Polymer Sickness Lesions. Points of interest can be played alongside a zone and can serve as landmarks for navigation by being held by players even after they have left the zone. These Points can allow for a rapid ascent back up through a depth should players need to at times. Some Zones will have unique Points of Interest that are tied to that Specific Zone and will be rolled instead on a given outcome. Players may find Points of Interest during Explore actions in the travel phase. . Example Zone: Sprawl: Locals: 4+(Passive, poly-humans and Autons). Hostiles: 1. Autofauna(atta), 6. Hostile Auton or Polyhumans Points of Interest: Res. Suite: Found on: 2 Residential suites are comfortable lodging left over in the memory of the Arcologies from time to time. These luxuriant locations are often excellent sites to take a break at and those that do will automatically recover two expended dice instead of one during a rest action. Description: Sprawl zones are common near the surface of any arcology. These large meandering housing blocks were meant to emulate the open spaces of an Earth long past. Canals of Effluvia flow between rows of buildings meant to house teeming millions that now lay empty and vacant. Here small Autofauna roam picking away at the softer structures that denser arcology zones lack. . Depth: Depth determines the overall risk to life and limb that a group of Divers might encounter. Depth starts at a value of zero. A dive team that wishes to go deeper into an Arcology must select their Site. This will be where they venture deeper into the tangle of Wiring, machinery and structures that have grown rampant over the preceding millenia. . COMBAT . The Era of the Post-Zenith is one abundant in danger. Auto-fauna roam the Arcologies alongside hostile groups of mercenaries, Cast off proxies and ancient Defense networks. As such many that explore the Arcologies are ready to fight for their lives. Combat in POLYMERGE is meant to be tense, fast paced and tactical to a degree. Characters that get into combat in POLYMERGE must plan carefully, selecting the appropriate weaponry, organoids and Hemes to survive. . The Round: We divide combat in POLYMERGE into various Rounds of combat. These are discrete but abstracted units of time in which characters may take actions such as Shooting, diving for cover or Jaunting. Each Round is further divided into Turns in which characters may act out their choice of action and determine the degree to which they were able to accomplish it. . The Turn: While we treat combat as a simultaneous event in which all parties are moving at once. We as players divide the round into turns. Each member of the Combat(Divers, Autofauna, NPCs etc.) will get to declare their chosen moves on their turn. A character will typically have 2 Actions to use during their turn. Characters with the Efficiency application gain one additional action per TWO ranks with the application. Additionally a Character may EXPEND a point of their Charge Rating to gain an additional action, this can be done a number of times equal to their Routing Application or once if they have no rating in it. . Actions: Characters in POLYMERGE can take a variety of actions in combat ranging from firing their weapon, charging a foe or diving from cover. Below we will go over the most common types of Actions that a character may perform while in a fight: . Attack(variable cost): The attack action is one of the most basic moves a character can take in combat. An attack requires a different amount of actions to use depending upon the weapon used by a character. An attack can be a standard test or a Vs. test. . Defend(1 action): Oftentimes a character will not simply take a hit. Characters can defend themselves By using Reaction, or Structure. Defend is a unique action because it can be used during another character’s turn. Doing so allows a character to turn an attack action into a versus test against their roll. If the defending character succeeds they negate the incoming damage completely. If the attacker beats the defender, they suffer the net success in damage. . Use(1 action): Characters may use items, or environmental effects to their advantage in combat. The Use action can be used only during a character’s turn though its effects might persist for longer. . Activate(1 action): A character may spend an action to activate an Organoid they are currently installed with. They must spend one action for each Organoid they wish to use as well as have the required amount of Charge to power it. . Jaunt(Special): A character may attempt to access the Wires during combat to execute a program. To do so they must spend at least once action to access the area network(see Jaunting for more). A character that has Jaunted cannot take further actions until they log out and cannot react to actions around them. They are treated as defenseless and immobile. . Aim/ready(1+ actions): Characters may sometimes need to take aim to make sure a shot lands or prepare a weapon for firing. When a character takes aim they convert one die into one automatic Success. They may do this once, or up to the number of times they have the Targeting application. Characters that are readying a weapon must expend a number of actions equal to the Weapons Charge/Recoil rating. . Charge(1+action): A character that charges is moving to close the gap between them and their target. This is typically done with melee weapons though some ranged weapons can be used while charging. A character that charges may move a number of zones equal to the actions they spend to do so and may if they reach a valid target immediately attack it. . Move(1+ action): A character may move from one Zone to another during combat. If they wish to move more than one zone at a time they must use more actions during their turn to do so. It should be noted some Zones might cost more actions to move through(such as wreckage). If a character moves from such a zone to one without a penalty(Wreckage to sprawl for example) they still must use the higher rate of actions for the initial move. . Attacking at range and in melee: Characters making an attack must consider where they are in relation to their target. When a character makes a ranged attack they must note how many zones away they are from their target, ranged weapons will have a Range(1-5 typically) this represents how many zones away a character can make an attack from. This does not mean they cannot try from further but suffer a -1D penalty for each zone they are further away from the target. Melee attacks must take place in the same zone as the target. Should they not be within the same zone the attack automatically will fail. . Armor: Protection comes in many forms in the world of POLYMERGE. Armor can be something as humble as the carapace of Auto-fauna hammered into a simple breastplate to something as Esoteric as a neutron shield that redirects incoming light or even a jamming signal meant to block out attacks from the Wires. Armor is divided into three broad classes: light(1-2), medium(3-4) and heavy(5-6). And has a corresponding Code much like weapons(refer to the table in Taking damage for further information on codes). This represents the area that is protected first by the armor such as Structure or Reaction while the number represent . Taking Damage: Eventually a character will have their luck run out. A stray shot will land, a shard of shrapnel will find its mark or a Polycyte will burrow into flesh. When a character takes damage they are losing their ability to function. Characters in POLYMERGE do not have Hit points rather they suffer damage to their various functions and applications. Weapons in POLYMERGE have an abbreviation: . Frame/FRA Ghost/GHO Structure/STR Process/PRO Reaction/REACT Personality/PER Power/POW Polymer/POLY . The corresponding Root or function is what will be affected by the attack first. A character may opt to either absorb the full damage at the targeted location OR they may Cascade the attack(Note a character wearing armor meant to protect the targeted area or a higher layer such as a Root can absorb the attack first with the armor reducing its rating by the amount of damage), distributing damage throughout their systems. A character that opts to Cascade must still take at least one point of damage to the targeted Function or Root. They may then distribute any further damage into lower layers(Applications, Derived Attributes, or certain pieces of gear or certain Organoids). At each layer they must select at least one location to take a point of damage, the location can take more if the character so chooses. Should the Damage exceed the rating of the affected area any excess damage automatically cascades to lower layers. Should the area not have any rating left the attack affects the next layer up instead and cannot be cascaded. Example: Talak the poly human is ambushed by a dangerous Auto-fauna. Its attack deals STR3. Talak opts to cascade the damage distributing one point to his Structure reducing it to 1 and taking the rest on his Strike application reducing it to zero. He now only has one die to use for Structure rolls and cannot use the Strike Application until he recovers from the damage. . Other forms of Damage: There are times a character might take damage not from an attack such as from falling from a ledge, or being caught in a dangerous environment. In these instances the Admin will need to declare the needed roll(for example reaction to not fall) should they fail the character treats the failure as an attack equal to the amount of failures rolled that is targeted at the Root of the function. This may still be cascaded as with a normal attack however unless specifically stated armor will not be able to be used to reduce the damage. . Root Failure: When a character’s Roots are reduced to zero there is a risk of permanent damage. Characters that have their Frame reduced to zero will no longer be able to function physically; their bodies will have become too damaged and will need to be repaired in some manner or, they must transfer into a new frame. A character may opt to reduce their Chassis rating permanently to restore function, restructuring their bodies or losing non-functional components. A character that has had their Ghost reduced to Zero however faces far more trouble. They cannot Jaunt until they have at least one point restored and automatically fail any tests involving Personality or Process. Characters may however permanently reduce their Mass rating to restore functionality, restoring nervous function by forcing nerve growth via polymer and wetware components installed in their bodies. . The Battlefield: POLYMERGE does not use a tactical grid of Hex maps. Rather it uses Zones, these are abstracted zones that represent broad areas within the wilds of an Arcology. Most Zones are Approx. a quarter Kilometer in area though some might be larger or much smaller such as in the case of Indoor spaces. Zones are declared by the Admin at the start of Combat. There may be a number of Zones in the combat equal to the Current Depth. These are, unless otherwise stated to be equally connected. It should be noted some Zones will have special rules, effects or their own hazards. An Admin may only have so many Zones active at a time, this is typically tied to the current Depth At which the party’s at. Some Effects may persist even after combat such as Shelters, Accessways and docking stations. Below are examples of Basic types of Zones, these are also used during exploration these all are found at any Depth and on any planet. . Sprawl: It extends into the infinite, a mass of habitats, micro-stations and causeways. Sprawl was meant to house the bulk of the human species. Now it impedes their descendents. Characters fighting among Sprawl gain no distinct Advantage or disadvantages. Should a Weapon have the DEVASTATE ability at a rating higher than the current depth and generate enough Fumbles to exceed the Depth minus twelve the Sprawl is converted into a wreckage Zone at the start of the next Round. . Processing: The Arcologies are almost living things. Within them vast cannula channels waste and raw materials into churning processing systems themselves almost like living things as they draw in raw material and spit out refined items in endless monotony. Characters in Processing Zones are able to find useful materials more readily even in the throws of combat. They may spend an action to recover either Wetware, Hardware or Chymus. This may be done as many times as the current Depth. Processing areas are volatile, Chyme churns are well known for their flammable compounds and Cannula can simply burst into fragmented storms of materials and acidic matter. Characters that use a weapon that deals Energy Damage must be careful as should they generate any Faults; these are treated as Damage against all combatants in the field. . Catalysis: Raw material is pulled via ducts and arterials. Here the great Dray-fauna come to die, their bodies torn down to components as the Arcologies move in their all consuming growth. Catalysis zones are hives of activity and often crawling with Auto-fauna, sessile system points and all manner of scavengers picking them over for useful goods to trade at nearby settlements. Characters that spend an action within a Catalysis zone may roll Polymer if they do and generate a number of DRIVES equal the current depth minus ten they are able to locate a PASSIVE organoid of their choosing. . Junction: The ancient road and rail networks, once beautifully orchestrated in their precise movements, now are tangles of lines, starts and stops, stations and depots. These vast mazes serve often as shortcuts to those that know how to use them. However, those that do not often can find themselves lost beyond saving, forever wandering the Arcology wilds in a vain hope of finding a way out. If a combat ends with a Junction Zone still on the field a character may attempt to use it to find a shortcut. They may roll Power to activate the network and must generate a number of Success equal to the current depth. If successful they are able to select the next area they go to. . Substations: The massive amount of energy needed for the Arcologies to function is often spread across the structures. This distributed system of fusion furnaces, mantle taps and Solar plantations provides the basic energy needs of many areas. Substations act as routing points, providing mostly stable supplies of power throughout vast expanses of the wild Arcologies. Such areas often crackle with magnetic storms and plasma surges and can be hazardous to those that are not used to diving. At the start of each round characters must make a Reaction test equal to the current depth. If they are unable to, they suffer one point of damage to their structure but gain one point to their Power rating. Should this reduce their Structure below zero they immediately take their Power rating in damage to their Frame rating. . Wreckage: The battlefields of twenty-thousand years litter the solar system. Warden purges, Corpo-state battlefields and Arc-tribal disputes leave ruins in their wake. Wreckage fields are almost as common as Sprawl. Broken sections of Arcology bone exposing polymer rich marrow beneath as Autofauna slowly work away, destroying the ruin in their mindless state as they rebuild the endless megastructures. Characters moving through a Wreckage Zone must spend two actions to move through the area; however attacks at range suffer a -1D penalty due to the abundant cover. . The Wires: Those that traverse the various fragmented networks of the Solar System are known by a hundred names, cutters, splicers, runners, the lost… But all share the common trait of knowing the means to Jaunt, or move through the Wires even if they do at great risk to their mental state and even sense of self but, the rewards for those that can survive and access sections of long forgotten data stores and overrides however is immense. In this section we will talk about the Wires, how a character Jaunts into them and the types of programs and risks they might encounter while in it. . Jaunts: We use the term Jaunt to describe when a character is accessing the complex network that is the Wires. To do so outside of combat a character can simply select the program they wish to use so long as they have the required amount of Process rating. If they do not they must use items, organoids or their Ghost rating to boost the rating but then must test. In Combat a character must spend their full Turn to activate a Jaunt. If they do so they may take no further action physically for the rest of the round. At the start of their next turn they may begin to perform actions in the Wires. Once they have started acting within the Wires they must be aware of the length of time that they are within the network. A character may spend a number of Rounds within the Wires without penalty equal to their Ghost-the current Depth. Once they have exceeded this number of rounds they will then lose one die for each additional round they are on a jaunt. A character can always exit and retry a jaunt but must spend their actions and lose the benefits of any ongoing programs if they do. . Actions in the Wires: Characters at the start of each round must Test their Process function instead of Reaction. This determines not only the turn on which they move but also many actions they can take during their turn. A character in the Wires adds the total amount of Success and Drives they rolled together, subtracting any Faults. For each success they gain one ‘process point’ for each Drive they gain two and for each fault rolled they lose one point. Process points are used to take actions in the Wires in a manner similar to how characters move within the physical world. They may use them in the following manner: . Execute(1+process point): Execute is the simplest action a character can take on a Jaunt. They expend a certain number of process points to activate a program that they have in their inventory and then apply its effects to the target. . Cache(1+ process point): The character stores an amount of Process Points equal to their Threading rating. These points can be carried over into the next round. However a character loses one die from their Process Test at the start of the next round for every 2 points saved this way. . Crypt(2+process point): A character may use this before an execute action. If they do so, any tests that the program requires will need one additional success for every two points used to crypt. A character can spend a number of process points this way equal to their Encryption rating. Additionally this may be used as a reaction to a hostile program by reducing the Test required by it by one for every two points. . Partition(1+process points): The character creates a segmented space within the Wires. This can help stave off infectious mal-memetics and ego-virii. A character that uses Partition increases the cost of any program used for the Round by the amount of Process Points they expended. They may do this up to their Encryption rating. If the Character that creates the Partition uses an Execute action however this effect immediately ends. . Variance( Process equal to current Round): A character may try to shift their location in relation to the world around them, accessing sections of the Wire that might otherwise be hard to reach or even prepare to translate into a new body on the fly. A character that uses Variance must spend a number of points equal to their current Depth. If they do so at the start of the next round they may treat their Jaunt as being at one Depth higher or lower effectively increasing or decreasing their current duration. . Programs: Programs are the primary means by which a character interacts with the Wires. These are stored within the minds of a character and can be called upon to perform various actions such as attacking a hostile entity or defending against security elements. Some Programs also allow characters in the Wires to interact with the physical world via changing the surrounding Arcology or summoning Auto-fauna. Characters can have as many programs as their Process and Threading ratings combined. Unlike Organoids characters cannot have more Programs than they do rating. All programs require a certain amount of Process Points to use, some however might require additional costs such as a minimum rating in Ghost or a certain depth or zone. Characters using such programs must be aware of these costs. . Duration, Depth and Security elements: Characters that Jaunt need to be aware of how long they are in the Wires not only due to the increased strain that results from wandering within the fragmented networks and servers of the post-Zenith solar system but also due to the risk of drawing the attention of long dormant security measures. When a character rolls more Faults than the current Depth they have stumbled across a hostile entity of the Wires. These are not like Auto-fauna or even Wire Walkers and Deserters but are much more primitive and dangerous programs designed to seek out and destroy trespassers. Security elements attack anything at the Current Depth that is on a Jaunt(a character may use Variance for example to avoid them). Security elements are considered to have a number of Process points each round equal to the current Depth. They do not need to roll at the start of a round and will always have that many to use. Security elements can only use the Execute action if a security element spends all their Process Points in a single round they are considered to have deactivated. Should they be targeted by damaging programs a character reduces their available process points, if this reaches zero they have shut down the security element. Security Elements have two programs available to them: . Fragment: Cost: 1+ Effect: This program deals Noise Damage equal to the amount of process points spent on this action. . Alert; Cost: 1+number of active security elements at current depth. Effect; When this program is used at the start of the next round one additional Security element with a number of Process Points equal to the current Depth -1 enters the Wires. . Gearing Up: Characters in Polymerge often will need to find what they can to survive. Scraps of wetware to ensure their organoids are healthy, refurbished weapons that have become fused to structural moorings after millenia of corrosion or even armor hammered into shape from the husks of dead Auto-fauna. These pieces of equipment can make the difference between a Diver being forever trapped in a broken body, lost in the Depths of an arcology wilderness and returning triumphant bearing artifacts and secrets of another age. This section will cover the various weapons, armor, tools, programs and organoids that a character may make use of as they plumb the depths of the Arcologies that now dominate the Solar System. . The Armory: Mankind and its descendants have long mastered the art of killing. During the Zenith murder was high art for those that controlled their own lives and a means to entertain the enthralled masses. Weaponry of all manner was available to those with the means to afford such deadly treasures. But that was then, this is now. Since the Fall, the descendants of Humanity have cobbled together scraps from that bygone era. These are pale imitations to the devastating tools of war that their ancestors and creators employed but deadly no less. . Damage Rating: The type of damage matters but there is also the matter of how much. Characters in polymerge have a variety of options to choose from in this regard. The exact shape of the weapon matters little and is left up to the players/admin. Rather we focus on the amount of Damage that a weapon does. This determines the cost of the weapon in question when combined with the Damage type and any other special qualities the weapon might have. We determine the base cost of a weapon by multiplying the amount of damage it deals(1-10) by 100. This sets our basic cost. Characters starting play however are limited to weaponry that deals between 1-4 damage. . Damage Types: In Polymerge weaponry has a Damage rating and a Damage type. These two factors determine how much damage a weapon does and to what Function or Root it targets. The following forms of Damage and what they target are below, additionally each category has a cost multiplier associated with it for pricing a weapon in category: . Kinetic: Target: Structure Cost Multiplier: 1x Kinetic damage is one of the oldest means of dispatching a foe. Characterized by sheer brute force it can wreak havoc on the integrity of an entity’s body and destroy critical structures within them. Kinetic weapons are typically simple in nature such as caseless rifles, simple melee weapons and even limbs being swung hard enough to shatter bone. . Remote: Target: Reaction Cost Multiplier: 1.5x Remote weaponry is designed to control the movements of their target, hemming in their actions by guessing where they will be and preventing counter moves. Such weapons are relatively common and serve as a means to fight against nimble enemies such as certain strains of proxy and auto-fauna. Common examples of remote weapons include homing cluster missiles, Splines and smart guns. . Energy: Target: Power Cost Multiplier: 2x Directed energy weapons can be deadly in the right hands. They can burn out delicate neural circuits and cause faults in cardiac regulators triggering cascading failure through key systems and even organoid damage. Energy weapons are rarer than they were during the Zenith, the delicate lenses, catalysts and tissues needed for them are harder to come by than they once were. Common Energy weapons include Microwave emitters and Electromagnetic blasting pikes. . Reactive: Target: Frame Cost: 4x Reactive weaponry is designed to break down the very chemical bonds of a structure. It dismembers and destroys with impunity and can be devastating to those that are not properly armored for such a weapon. Common Reactive weapons include Synergy blades and Hellburner rifles. . Noise: Target: Process Cost: 1x Weapons that deal noise damage are meant to drown out the ability of an entity to think clearly. They override the senses with clutter and throw the mind into disarray. Noise is often the simplest method of attack for entities residing in the wires. Examples of Noise weaponry include Programs such as Choir and Cacophony. . Memetic: Target: Personality Cost: 1.5x Weapons that deal memtic damage overwrite and implant intrusive ideas into the mental framework of the target. These are often used not to kill but render a target unable to call for help or sabotage them in some subtle means. Examples of weapons that deal memetic damage include programs such as Ticker, and Fugue. . Phage: Target: Polymer Cost: 2x Polyrobes were long ago weaponized. Weapons that deal phage damage use aggressive, often short lived strains to override and disable their targets ability to use organoids and take in Polymer. Phage weapons including Heme spikes and PS cultures. Obliteration: Target: Ghost Cost: 4x Weapons that deal Obliteration damage are designed not to simply kill but erase. These are devastating as they can remove and delete otherwise well protected core personality engrams and memories rendering a target little more than an empty husk. Examples of obliteration weapons include Programs such as Mercy and Reset. . Gravitic: Target: All Cost: 10x Gravitic weapons were some of the most devastating creations of the Zenith era. These often humble looking weapons were able to manipulate gravity fields to rapidly increase localized gravity in some manner. The most common example of these were Neutron Rifles that could launch a piece of condensed matter at near relativistic speed. The effects were such that Cleanser teams of Wardens would often fire a single round during sterilization, and remove entire lesions in the process. Gravitic weapons deal their damage rating to all Roots and Functions at Once. They can still be cascaded however. . Qualities: Weapons in Polymerge along with a Damage Rating, and a Damage Type also often have qualities. These impart special effects onto the weapons and change how they function. All weapons have at least one of the Following Qualities: Melee or Ranged, Wired. For each additional quality a character must factor in the cost of the quality. . Melee: Cost: 0 Melee weapons use the Strike Function to make attacks. . Ranged: Cost: 0 Ranged weapons use the Targeting function to make attacks . Wired: Cost: 0 Wired Weapons use the Process Function and are treated as Programs. They require 1 process point for each point of damage they deal to be used. . Other Qualities: Barrage: Cost: 100/rank This weapon can hit several targets at once, when a character makes a successful attack with a weapon with the Barrage quality, for each Drive rolled they may distribute one point of damage to another target within the same Zone. . Quick Attack: Cost: 200/rank(max three) This weapon is designed for rapid successive attacks. A character that rolls 4 drives(-1 per rank) may make an immediate attack at -1damage after the first, they must still roll. Should a character roll enough Drives to activate Quick attack again they may do so again with the same penalties to damage. . Hybrid: Cost: X Hybrid weaponry can deal damage with a second Damage type. When this weapon is built add in the cost of the Hybrid Weapons Damage Rating and Type to the Base weapon. The Hybrid function cannot be used in the same action as the normal attack however and a character must declare if they are using the Hybrid quality before they use the weapon. . Distance: Cost: 50/rank This weapon can hit targets in other zones. All weapons start with a base Distance of 0 meaning they can only hit characters in the same zone. For each rank bought(up to the Damage Rating of the weapon) this weapon can hit a target that many Zones away. . Ammo: Cost: 25/rank Weapons with the Ammo quality have a limited amount of ammo, while many weapons of the Zenith either generate their own ammunition or use such esoteric methods such as Directed light and electromagnetic radiation to attack. Some weapons still have a limited amount of ammunition. A character wielding a weapon with the Ammo quality may expend a point of the Ammo rank to add +1d6 to their next attack roll with this weapon. They may do this as many times as their reaction function. However, a weapon that has reduced their Ammo rating to Zero can no longer be used without being reloaded using a magazine. . Destructive: Cost: 500/rank This weapon is immensely powerful and can turn whole swathes of arcology into little more than Rubble. For Each rank of Destructive a character can spend a Drive. If they spend enough Drives on their attack roll to exceed the current depth the Zone they are in as well as any Zones within range of the attack are reduced to Rubble. In addition the attack hits all targets within the same Zone that is destroyed. . Pierce: Cost: 100/rank This weapon is able to negate a certain amount of protection offered by armor. For each rank of Pierce this weapon ignores one point of Armor. . Linger: Cost: 50/rank This weapon’s effects can carry over into the rounds after its initial hit. When a character makes a successful attack with a weapon that Linger. Each Round after it does one point less of damage to the same Function or route until it no longer deals damage. These effects cannot stack. . Charge; Cost/Refund: 25xDamage Rating This weapon needs to generate a certain amount of power before it can deal it’s full damage. Charge weapons require a number of actions equal to the Damage rating of the weapon before an attack can be made at its full rating. A character can always opt to use it as a partial charge but this reduces the Damage dealt by the number of actions spent charging to a minimum of one. . Unstable: Cost/Refund: 50xDamage Rating This weapon is not safe to handle with unskilled hands. A character that rolls any faults when making an attack with this weapon suffers an immediate hit with the weapon equal to the amount of Faults rolled(up to the Damage Rating). This will happen even if the attack was successful. . Recoil: Cost/refund: 25x rank(max damage rating) This weapon has substantial force behind its shots or swings and its users must be capable of handling the blowback of force. When a character makes an attack roll and produces a number of faults greater than the Recoil rating faults they must immediately make a Force or Structure test that requires a number of successes equal to the damage rating of the weapon. If they do fail they cannot attack with this weapon the next turn and lose as many actions as the Recoil Rating. . Armor: While there are certainly many ways for a character to take damage there are near as many to protect themselves. Armor covers a character and helps mitigate damage. Armor can be used in two ways, the first is passively this automatically reduces incoming damage from attacks by the rating of the armor. The second is Actively, a character may reduce the rating of the armor they are wearing by one. If they do so, they negate all incoming damage from the attack but now have one less point of armor protecting them going forward. . Light, medium, Heavy: Armor is divided into Light, medium and heavy grades. Each type has its own multiplier for cost alongside the given rating. Light armor has a base multiplier of fifty, Medium armor has a base multiplier of one hundred and heavy a base multiplier of 150. Below is a chart showing the range for armor to be considered each class: . Class/multiplier Rating light/x50 1 light /x50 2 medium/x100 3 medium/x100 4 Heavy/x150 5 Heavy/x150 6 . Armor Types: Armor comes in three Broad Types that cover a given group of roots and Functions. They are explained below. . Composite: Composite protects Frame and all of its Functions. This type of armor is typically made of hardened plates of Auto-fauna hulls or produced from processed Chyme residue. Composite armor is common throughout the Solar System. . Cryptic: Cryptic armor is typically integrated into the body in some manner such as through neural packets or via specialized organoids. Cryptic Armor protects the Ghost Root and its Functions. . Cyte: Cyte Armors are rare and are exemplified by the likes of Vacusytes and Karasytes. These are integrated organoids typically that enclose their host wearer and provide coverage against not only Physical attack by assaults via the Wires through the use of their own cryptic neural patterns acting to protect a character wearing one from all manner of harm. Cyte Armor also is automatically double the cost of what the armor normally would be. . Qualities: Like weapons, armor can have additional qualities that set it apart. Below we list some common qualities and their cost increases. Armor can only have one positive and one negative quality. . Reinforced: Cost: 100/rank This armor is designed to withstand a specific type of damage. When its built a character may select the Damage Type and Rank of the Reinforcement. When hit by attacks that deal that type of damage it adds that amount of rating to its defense. . Bulky: Refund: 100 This armor is not well suited to rapid movement. A character wearing armor with the Bulky quality takes a -1D to reaction tests. . Ablative: Cost: 200 Ablative armor is designed to withstand additional punishment, shedding less armor when it absorbs a particular massive hit. When a character uses their armor actively, roll a D6 if the die result is less than the rating of the armor it does not lose a point of rating. However if the result is over it loses two points instead as the layers are burned/shattered far faster than it was designed for. . Stealth: Cost: 200 This armor is designed to blend in with the Surrounding Arcology or network systems. When a Character is using Armor with the Stealth Quality they may reroll a Reaction die once per test if the armor is Composite or Extend the Length of a Jaunt by one round if the Armor is Cryptic. . Specialized: Cost: 100/rank When this armor is made select a specific damage type. When a character is hit with this type of damage they add the Rating of this quality to the armor. . Extremely Bulky: Refund: 200 This armor is heavy enough to slow down most wearers. A character takes a penalty to their reaction Tests Equal to the difference between the Armor rating and the Characters Structure Function. Kinetic attacks against the character deal -1 damage. Characters wearing Extremely Bulky armor always take a minimum of -1d to their Reaction rolls regardless of if there would be no penalty. . Organoids: Organoids fill a wide array of roles in the setting of POLYMERGE. Characters will need to be conscious not only of how many organoids they have but of how much power they require. Organoids are in essence grafted into the tissues of the host body and can be removed with some effort and a skilled technician’s hand. Each Organoid has an amount of Mass it requires within the body as well as an amount of Charge to be active. Characters can only have as many Organoids as their mass however they may have more than their Charge rating. Additionally Organoids can be ‘cultivated’ by a character through the ingestion of Wetware. When a character ingests enough Wetware equal to the Cultivation rating of the Organoid they may ‘cultivate’ this can offer increased bonuses, new ways to use the organoid or even the ability to generate an extra copy. When a Character takes damage we reduce the Mass rating of Organoids should the Mass rating be reduced to zero the organoid is considered destroyed. Additionally a damage Organoid cannot be cultivated and any wetware ingested instead repairs the organoid by 1 point for each wetware consumed. Below we will list a few common Organoids and how they operate. . Neural Interfacer: Mass: 2 Charge: 0 Cultivation: 4 This organoid is one of the most common, grafting itself into the cerebrum and allowing a character to interact with various craft. Neural Interfacers are usually specially designed for a specific type of vessel such as atmospheric or vacuum capable ships. Cultivation effect: This organoid can be copied generating a new organoid that can then be harvested from the host body or, it can broaden its format code allowing it to interface with another type of vessel. Special: the organoid requires at least one unit of wetware from the new type of vessel it is interfacing with. . Neural Buffer: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation: 3 This organoid was likely an offshoot of interfacers. Its structure is similar to that ancient form. These however are designed with the Wires in mind and grant the Character Cryptic Armor of a rating of 1. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can be cultivated to better encrypt the engrams of a character and can be cultivated to increase its Cryptic rating by 1. It also can be cultivated to better enable Jaunts and gain the Stealth Quality instead. . Jaunt Organoid,basic: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation: 2 This is one of the oldest forms of organoid. Developed first during the Zenith and produced en masse ever sense. This allows a character access to the Wires and the use of Programs. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can be cultivated to better access the Wires, extending the Duration of a jaunt by one additional round per cultivation or it can be nourished to better process data streams, upgrading one die of a Process Function test. . Spline: Mass: 2 Charge: 2 Cultivation Cost: 4 This Organoid is designed for combat, Anchoring itself into the body via the rib cage and controlled via the Spinal cord. Splines are considered Composite Armor with a Rating of 1. Cultivation Effect: This organoid can replicate creating multiple splines to defend the Host, for each cultivation performed increase the rating by 1. Additionally it can be cultivated into a deadly weapon, if cultivated in this manner the Spline is treated as a melee weapon that deals Kinetic damage equal to its rating. If this is done however it cannot be used to defend in the same round that it attacks. . Identifiers: Mass: 1 Charge: 1 Cultivation Cost: N/A Identifiers are special organoids that are used by various factions as a means to ensure security of their facilities. Identifiers are able to access their home domains. . Catalyzers: Mass: 3 Charge: 2 Cultivation Cost: 6 Catalyzers are special organoids designed to allow beings to process various substances that otherwise might be toxic. A character that has a catalyzer is able to consume a substance and in turn generate wetware that is incorporated into their bodies. The Rate of Catalyzing is the same as the Cultivation cost(6:1). This wetware can be used by other Organoids for Cultivation inside the characters body or harvested with a Reaction test of 2. Cultivation effect: By cultivation a character can adapt the organoid into metabolizing other substances of their choosing(such as Chyme or Composite) or reduce the Ratio needed for wetware by one. This latter ability can be cultivated up to three times. . Enemies and Non-player Characters: Various beings controlled by the Admin are called Non-player Characters. They are not controlled by the players but still will have their own agency, means and goals that they might act out either to aid or hinder the party. . Zones, Exploration Tables: This section covers the standard set of Zones that players will encounter as well as tables and special rules that might be included with them. . Movement Table Result Zone 1 Sprawl 2 Hi-rise 3 Viaduct 4 Fuel Nectary 5 Wrecker-field 6 Effluvia reservoir 7 Wetware Bloom 8 Conduit Tangle 9 Bore Chasms 10 Refinery Caverns 11 Server forest 12 Crush. . Zones: . Sprawl: Locals: 4+(Passive, poly-humans and Autons). Hostiles: 1. Autofauna (atta), 6. Hostile Auton or Polyhumans Points of Interest: Res. Suite: Found on: 2 Residential suites are comfortable lodging left over in the memory of the Arcologies from time to time. These luxuriant locations are often excellent sites to take a break at and those that do will automatically recover two expended dice instead of one during a rest action. Description: Sprawl zones are common near the surface of any arcology. These large meandering housing blocks were meant to emulate the open spaces of an Earth long past. Canals of Effluvia flow between rows of buildings meant to house teeming millions that now lay empty and vacant. Here small Autofauna roam picking away at the softer structures that denser arcology zones lack. . Hi-Rise: Locals: 2(Isolated poly-humans and Auton settlements) Hostiles: 1-2 Flying Autofauna, Points of Interest: Citadel: Found on: 5 Citadels are often left over from Poly-human and Auton tribes as they roam among the spires of the Zone. These are fortified structures that offer excellent security to stage further expeditions. Effect: The next Exploration roll in this Zone that would be Hostile is instead rerolled. The Dive team must abide by the second outcome however. . Corpo-Block: Found on: 7+ The Remains of a long dead corporation. These collections of Towers and skywalks are often heavily fortified and prowled by Helota. But, the risk can be worth it. Within their corridors the lucky and tenacious might be able to find artifacts from another era or ancient Servers loaded with information to sell to the highest bidder. Effect: The Dive team has found a ruin. Description: Dominating the skylines of most Arcologies. Hi-rise zones can reach for a kilometer or more into the atmosphere of their planetary hosts. These collections of narrow winding bridges, walkways and tightly packed towers create a claustrophobic environment that poses risks to those that are not prepared for it. Special effect: When in Combat in Hi-rise anytime a character rolls 3 or more faults they risk falling and must make an immediate reaction test(2) should they fail they suffer the amount of Faults rolled to their Frame. . Viaduct: Locals: N/A Hostiles: 4(large autofauna) Points of Interest: Pile-up: Found on: 2-3 Pile ups are not uncommon along the twisting pathways that connect various Zones. These large collections of Auto-fauna Corpses tend to occur during routing errors between feeding points or when a Hive has been hijacked by malware. They are foetid piles of metal, wetware and leaking fluids that pose no threat beyond their smell and that the party must move around it somehow. Effect:The next move action taken by the party must Expend two dice instead of one. Description: Viaducts link various Zones together or at least they once did. In the current era they are simmering plains of paved roadways, parking lagoons with coolant and fuel bubbling into small pools for Autofauna to stop at and twisting half kilometer wide pathways that blaze a trail across the planet. While their open expanses make for little shelter they allow for speedy travel when needed. Characters moving along a Viaduct need not expend dice to move to a new zone. Effect: If the Dive team has a ground vehicle they do not need to expend any Dice to move into a new zone and may instead expend one of the vehicles in their place. . Fuel Nectary: Locals: 2-3(Autons), 5(Poly-humans) Hostiles: 2(Flying Autofauna), 5(Autofauna),8(Hostile Dive Team) Points of Interest: Concentrator: Found on: 7 These large open air platforms simmer with volatile chemicals, a soup of high energy fuel that can be used for a variety of vehicles and mounts. However such areas are prone to being chemically unstable and risk explosions. Effect: characters may recover 1 die each along with their vehicles/mounts. If the character is an Auton this is increased to 2 dice. However Combat in the area is hazardous, weapons that deal energy damage when used in the Zone and roll of 2 or more faults immediately turns the Zone into wreckage and deals that much Damage in Structure to all characters in the Zone. . Nest factories: Found on: 5 Many types of Autofauna are found near Fuel nectaries, the ample amount of supplies needed to maintain optimal performance allow for greater concentrations of them than elsewhere. Oftentime some species will come to dominate such a location creating nest factories that produce new auto-fauna with a rapid pace. Effect: The party has located a Nest of Autofauna. Description: The age of simple fueling stations was long since over by the Zenith. Necateries produce a variety of stable but volatile fluids and solids that are secreted from specialized towers or housed within Bulbous Tanks and lagoons. Here all manner of Autofauna venture to refuel alongside Poly-human tribes that hunt them for food and supplies and Autons that derive similar nourishment from the pools of bubbling liquid. Effect: When characters rest at a Fuel Nectary and expend a die, if the result is an even number they encounter a friendly group of Autons, if it is odd they are Poly-humans. Wrecker-field: Locals: 1(Deserters),6(autons) Hostiles: 1(Hostile Diver Team), 5+(Auto-fauna scavengers) Points of Interest: Dray Beast Corpse: Found on: 4 The massive Auto-fauna often called Dray-beasts are lumbering behemoths that ingest all that they see in a slow procession only to eventually grind to a halt, their internals either left to be subsumed by the Arcology around it or picked apart by nearby auto-fauna. Dive teams are no exception to taking advantage of such opportunities. Effect: The Party may select to Expend one die per party member of Structure or Power if they do so, roll that die. They add that much Wetware to their inventory. Description: Wrecker-fields litter the Arcologies, teeming with scavengers of all manner picking over the pieces of Auto-fauna searching for useful parts and wetware. They are foetid places that are filled with crumbling chassis and fields of stagnant fluids. Effect: Characters must expend at least one die to rest. If they do not they will not recover any dice. . Effluvia Reservoir: Locals: 3(auton and polyhuman nomads) Hostiles: 5(Hostile Polyhumans and Autons) 7+(Auto-fauna) Points of Interest: Junk Reef: Found on: 3 The Detritus that makes its way into the swirling pools and currents of Effluvia sometimes will collect hard to break down debris. This ‘junk’ develops into rocklike outcrops, Polyrobes binding tight together to form rocky shoals and reefs. These islands and shallows can provide respite to those that know how to navigate them. Effect: Characters may make a Reaction(2) test if they do so they may recover two dice in their next rest. Description: Effluvia is the precursor to the valuable Chyme. Here water, debris and mild acids mix together to form vast frothing pools that can stretch for thousands of kilometers, their evaporates driving whole cycles of acid rains that slowly wear away at the arcology around it, eroding the landscape and creating a myriad of hazards beyond the simple open distance that such large quantities of liquids create. Effect: Characters must expend Three Dice to move past this zone or must have a vehicle/mount. . Wetware Blossom: Locals: 2-4(Poly human tribe) Hostiles: 6-9(Autofauna), 1(Hostile Poly humans) Points of Interest: Chyme Spring: Found on: 4-6 Bubbling up from deep below thick and viscous is the chyme. Across the Arcologies it emerges from the cannula, spires jutting from the landscape, from these in thick rivulets it forms pools and drainage, feeding out across the Arcology. Often these are small amounts, most of it soaked up by the surrounding structures before it can be harvested. But sometimes they form great gushers, and bubbling tar like springs that can be readily harvested by those that find them. Reroll a Die that was expended for exploration if the outcome is a 1 this spring is unclaimed and the Dive Team can claim it. If it is any other result there is already some form of inhabitants. Effect: Chyme can have powerful restorative effects when properly treated. Characters can make a Polymer Test(1+depth) to ingest the Chyme safely. If they do so they are able to metabolize it in its raw state and can immediately cultivate one organoid of their choice. Description: Wetware once filled a variety of roles, the semi-organic technology fed the masses, purified the air and water and even grew whole new body parts en masse. But, as the Polymer Sickness spread, control was lost. And survival became the key function of all the various tissues that the Zenith had created. Wetware Blossoms burst from the Foundational bones, living parasitically in the arcology marrow until the time is right. With thunderous cracking and explosive force wetware blossoms come to life. Tissue interlaced with synaptic circuitry feeds back guiding vascular pumps and metabolic systems. The air is ripe with life and energy, here something lives even if it might not be immediately recognizable to those that venture to the surface. Effect: When characters explore a Wetware Blossom Zone they automatically may gain one wetware. . Conduit Tangle: Locals: 2(Poly Human Tribes) Hostiles: 3(Autofauna) 4-5(Raiding party, Autons or Poly Human) Points of Interest: Wire Knot: Found on: 8 .",

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
