            "content": "POLYMERGE Rules V.01 . What this is: . POLYMERGE is a TTRPG/world inspired by the works of the likes of Tsumoto Nihei, Giger and countless others. This is a dark far future sci-fantasy world that takes place within our Solar System after it has been radically altered by mankind for thousands of years and then left to stagnate into a new dark age that has lasted for twenty-thousand years. In it players will adventure through Arcology Wilds, vast living cityscapes that grow and change of their own accord that have become inhabited by Auto-Fauna . Glossolalia: . Admin: The Game master, they adjudicate the various challenges that players will encounter as they explore the Solar System. . Diver: The player Character’s avatar in the Game World. Divers explore dangerous parts of the Solar System in hopes of finding ancient artifacts and riches. . Auto-fauna: The various non-sentient, animal-like machine organisms that inhabit the Solar system. Auto-fauna arose from the vehicles, devices and factories that Humanity had constructed during the Zenith, a previous golden age. . Polymer: A form of stable meta-material that was used to engineer the technology of the Zenith. In its raw state it has a pearlescent shine. . Polyrobe: a form of machine-organism that is microscopic in scale and was used for a wide array of purposes ranging from engineering to medicine. An uncontrolled strain of Polyrobe is responsible for the outbreak of Polymer Sickness. . Polymer Sickness: A disease that originated from a variety of polyrobe meant to terraform planets. It devastated the Solar System and ended the Zenith, a golden age. Polymer sickness is capable of rapidly and grotesquely mutating the hosts into drone bodies used to carry out the corrupted core programming of aggressive terraforming and Network setup. . Inheritors: The Various Species that arose after the Zenith which are descended from Humans or their creations. . Organoids: Various techno-organic implantable organs that are used for a wide array of purposes ranging from armor and weaponry to more utilitarian uses such as gaining access to secure sites or the Wires. . The Wires: Various now unstable networks that made up the information and economic systems of the Zenith era. Used by all manner of entities to ‘jaunt’ and gain access to information and data that might otherwise be lost. . Wetware: The semi-organic tissues that comprise much of the Post-zenith technology and life forms. Wetware is integrated through Polymer and can be consumed both for nutrition and to enhance organoids. . The Zenith: The era in which Humanity was able to engineer much of the technology that now runs rampant. The Zenith saw large-scale use of the resources of the Solar System and the start towards such things as Interstellar Travel and manipulation of fundamental forces such as gravity. The setting of Polymerge is set over twenty-thousand years after the end of the Zenith after Polymer-Sickness destroyed that society and its infrastructure. . How to play: . Polymerge uses an assortment of polyhedral dice that are rolled to perform various tasks such as escaping parties of Deserters, fighting off dangerous Auto-fauna or using the The Wires. Characters will use different sized dice depending upon factors such as available applications, damage status and Organoids are used. Below is not only the various parts of a character but also the die that is used with it. . Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
